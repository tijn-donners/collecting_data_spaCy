# Female Abolitionist Poets

## 1. Corpus
This dataset contains a brief selection of female authored poets, manually collected from [Brycchan Carey's website](https://brycchancarey.com/slavery/poetry.htm)
This list contains several poems authored by both men and women, but for the scope of this project (max 10.000 tokens) a selection of female poetry has been made. 

The target audience is anyone who is interested in abolitionist or female literature, or anybode else who might find this data useful in any way.

As mentioned before, the poems that were selected had the criterium of female authorship and token length. 

The data has manually been collected from [Brycchan Carey's website](https://brycchancarey.com/slavery/poetry.htm), who provides a preselection of antislavery poems in digital format. The metadata has also been manually created.

## Preproccesing
Since the text was already converted to a digital format by Bracchan Carey, no data cleaning measures have been taking. The tokenization and lemmatization was performed using the spaCy library for python, and the code can be reviewed in the Jupyter Notebook in this repo.

## Data Formats
The data is provided in .txt format. The metadata and the annotation data are provided as .csv files.
