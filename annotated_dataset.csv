IF heaven has into being deign'd to call Thy light, O LIBERTY! to shine on all; Bright intellectual Sun! why does thy ray To earth distribute only partial day? Since no resisting cause from spirit flows 5 Thy penetrating essence to opose; No obstacles by Nature's hand imprest, Thy subtle and ethereal beams arrest; Nor motion's laws can speed thy active course, Nor strong repulsion's pow'rs obstruct thy force; 10 Since there is no convexity in MIND, Why are thy genial beams to parts confin'd? 2 While the chill North with thy bright ray is blest, Why should fell darkness half the South invest? Was it decreed, fair Freedom! at thy birth, 15 That thou shou'd'st ne'er irradiate all the earth? While Britain basks in thy full blaze of light, Why lies sad Afric quench'd in total night? Thee only, sober Goddess! I attest, In smiles chastis'd, and decent graces drest. 20 Not that unlicens'd monster of the crowd, Whose roar terrific bursts in peals so loud, Deaf'ning the ear of Peace: fierce Faction's tool; Of rash Sedition born, and mad Misrule; Whose stubborn mouth, rejecting Reason's rein, 25 No strength can govern, and no skill restrain; Whose magic cries the frantic vulgar draw To spurn at Order, and to outrage Law; 3 To tread on grave Authority and Pow'r, And shake the work of ages in an hour: 30 Convuls'd her voice, and pestilent her breath, She raves of mercy, while she deals out death: Each blast is fate; she darts from either hand Red conflagration o'er th' astonish'd land; Clamouring for peace, she rends the air with noise, 35 And to reform a part, the whole destroys. O, plaintive Southerne! * whose impassion'd strain So oft has wak'd my languid Muse in vain! Now, when congenial themes her cares engage, She burns to emulate thy glowing page; 40 Her failing efforts mock her fond desires, She shares thy feelings, not partakes thy fires. Strange pow'r of song! the strain that warms the heart Seems the same inspiration to impart; * Author of the Tragedy of Oronoko 4 Touch'd by the kindling energy alone, 45 We think the flame which melts us is our own; Deceiv'd, for genius we mistake delight, Charm'd as we read, we fancy we can write. Tho' not to me, sweet Bard, thy pow'rs belong Fair Truth, a hallow'd guide! inspires my song. 50 Here Art wou'd weave her gayest flow'rs in vain, For Truth the bright invention wou'd disdain. For no fictitious ills these numbers flow, But living anguish, and substantial woe; No individual griefs my bosom melt, 55 For millions feel what Oronoko felt: Fir'd by no single wrongs, the countless host I mourn, by rapine dragg'd from Afric's coast. Perish th'illiberal thought which wou'd debase The native genius of the sable race! 60 5 Perish the proud philosophy, which sought To rob them of the pow'rs of equal thought! Does then th' immortal principle within Change with the casual colour of a skin? Does matter govern spirit? or is mind 65 Degraded by the form to which 'tis join'd? No: they have heads to think, and hearts to feel, And souls to act, with firm, tho' erring, zeal; For they have keen affections, kind desires, Love strong as death, and active patriot fires; 70 All the rude energy, the fervid flame, Of high-soul'd passion, and ingenuous shame: Strong, but luxuriant virtues boldly shoot From the wild vigour of a savage root. Nor weak their sense of honour's proud control, 75 For pride is virtue in a Pagan soul; 6 A sense of worth, a conscience of desert, A high, unbroken haughtiness of heart: That self-same stuff which erst proud empires sway'd, Of which the conquerers of the world were made. 80 Capricious fate of man! that very pride In Afric scourg'd, in Rome was deify'd. No Muse, O * Quashi! shall thy deeds relate, No statue snatch thee from oblivious fate! * It is a point of honour among negroes of a high spirit to die rather than to suffer their glossy skin to bear the mark of the whip. Qua-shi had somehow offended his master, a young planter with whom he had been bred up in the endearing intimacy of a play-fellow. His services had been faithful; his attachment affectionate. The master resolved to punish him, and persued him for that purpose. In trying to escape Qua-shi stumbled and fell; the master fell upon him; they wrestled long with doubtful victory; at length Qua-shi got uppermost, and, being firmly seated on his master's breast, he secured his legs with one hand, and with the other drew a sharp knife; then said, ""Master, I have been bred up with you from a child; I have loved you as myself: in 7 For thou wast born where never gentle Muse 85 On Valour's grave the flow'rs of Genius strews; And thou wast born where no recording page Plucks the fair deed from Time's devouring rage. Had Fortune plac'd thee on some happier coast, Where polish'd souls heroic virtue boast, 90 To thee, who sought'st a voluntary grave, Th' uninjur'd honours of thy name to save, Whose generous arm thy barbarous Master spar'd, Altars had smok'd, and temples had been rear'd. Whene'er to Afric's shores I turn my eyes, 95 Horrors of deepest, deadliest guilt arise; return, you have condemned me to a punishment of which I must ever have borne the marks: thus only can I avoid them;"" so saying, he drew the knife with all his strength across his own throat, and fell down dead, without a groan, on his master's body. Ramsay's Essay on the Treatment of African Slaves. 8 I see, by more than Fancy's mirror shewn, The burning village, and the blazing town: See the dire victim torn from social life, The shrieking babe, the agonizing wife! 100 She, wretch forlorn! is dragg'd by hostile hands, To distant tyrants sold, in distant lands! Transmitted miseries, and successive chains, The sole sad heritage her child obtains! Ev'n this last wretched boon their foes deny, 105 To weep together, or together die. By felon hands, by one relentless stroke, See the fond links of feeling nature broke! The fibres twisting round a parent's heart, Torn from their grasp, and bleeding as they part. 110 Hold, murderers, hold! not aggravate distress; Respect the passions you yourselves possess; 9 Ev'n you, of ruffian heart, and ruthless hand, Love your own offspring, love your native land. Ah! leave them holy Freedom's cheering smile, 115 The heav'n-taught fondness for the parent soil; Revere affections mingled with our frame, In every nature, every clime the same; In all, these feelings equal sway maintain; In all the love of HOME and FREEDOM reign: 120 And Tempe's vale, and parch'd Angola's sand, One equal fondness of their sons command. Th' unconquer'd Savage laughs at pain and toil, Basking in Freedom's beams which gild his native soil. Does thirst of empire, does desire of fame, 125 (For these are specious crimes) our rage inflame? No: sordid lust of gold their fate controls, The basest appetite of basest souls; 10 Gold, better gain'd, by what their ripening sky, Their fertile fields, their arts * and mines supply. 130 What wrongs, what injuries does Oppression plead To smooth the horror of th' unnatural deed? What strange offence, what aggravated sin? They stand convicted--of a darker skin! Barbarians, hold! th' opprobious commerce spare, 135 Respect his sacred image which they bear: Tho' dark and savage, ignorant and blind, They claim the common privilege of kind; Let Malice strip them of each other plea, They still are men, and men shou'd still be free. 140 Insulted Reason, loaths th' inverted trade-- Dire change! the agent is the purchase made! * Besides many valuable productions of the soil, cloths and carpets of exquisite manufacture are brought from the coast of Guinea. 11 Perplex'd, the baffled Muse involves the tale; Nature confounded, well may language fail! The outrag'd Goddess with abhorrent eyes 145 Sees MAN the traffic, SOULS the merchandize! Plead not, in reason's palpable abuse, Their sense of * feeling callous and obtuse: From heads to hearts lies Nature's plain appeal, Tho' few can reason, all mankind can feel. 150 Tho' wit may boast a livelier dread of shame, A loftier sense of wrong refinement claim; Tho' polished manners may fresh wants invent, And nice distinctions nicer souls torment; Tho' these on finer spirits heavier fall, 155 Yet natural evils are the same to all. * Nothing is more frequent than this cruel and stupid argument, that they do not feel the miseries inflicted on them as Europeans would do. 12 Tho' wounds there are which reason's force may heal, There needs no logic sure to make us feel. The nerve, howe'er untutor'd, can sustain A sharp, unutterable sense of pain; 160 As exquisitely fashion'd in a slave, As where unequal fate a sceptre gave. Sense is as keen where Congo's sons preside, As where proud Tiber rolls his classic tide. Rhetoric or verse may point the feeling line, 165 They do not whet sensation, but define. Did ever slave less feel the galling chain, When Zeno prov'd there was no ill in pain? Their miseries philosophic quirks deride, Slaves groan in pangs disown'd by Stoic pride. 170 When the fierce Sun darts vertical his beams, And thirst and hunger mix their wild extremes; 13 When the sharp iron * wounds his inmost soul, And his strain'd eyes in burning anguish roll; Will the parch'd negro find, ere he expire, 175 No pain in hunger, and no heat in fire? For him, when fate his tortur'd frame destroys, What hope of present fame, or future joys? For this, have heroes shorten'd nature's date; For that, have martyrs gladly met their fate; 180 But him, forlorn, no hero's pride sustains, No martyr's blissful visions sooth his pains; Sullen, he mingles with his kindred dust, For he has learn'd to dread the Christian's trust; * This is not said figuratively. The writer of these lines has seen a complete set of chains, fitted to every separate limb of these unhappy, innocent men; together with instruments for wrenching open the jaws, contrived with such ingenious cruelty as would shock the humanity of an inquisitor. 14 To him what mercy can that Pow'r display, 185 Whose servants murder, and whose sons betray? Savage! thy venial error I deplore, They are not Christians who infest thy shore. O thou sad spirit, whose preposterous yoke The great deliver Death, at length, has broke! 190 Releas'd from misery, and escap'd from care, Go meet that mercy man deny'd thee here. In thy dark home, sure refuge of th' opress'd, The wicked vex not, and the weary rest. And, if some notions, vague and undefin'd, 195 Of future terrors have assail'd thy mind; If such thy masters have presum'd to teach, As terrors only they are prone to preach; (For shou'd they paint eternal Mercy's reign, Where were th' oppressor's rod, the captive's chain?) 200 15 If, then, thy troubled soul has learn'd to dread The dark unknown thy trembling footsteps tread; On HIM, who made thee what thou art, depend; HE, who withholds the means, accepts the end. Not thine the reckoning dire of LIGHT abus'd, 205 KNOWLEDGE disgrac'd, and LIBERTY misus'd; On thee no awful judge incens'd shall sit For parts perverted, and dishonour'd wit. Where ignorance will be found the surest plea, How many learn'd and wise shall envy thee! 210 And thou, WHITE SAVAGE! whether lust of gold, Or lust of conquest, rule thee uncontrol'd! Hero, or robber!--by whatever name Thou plead thy impious claim to wealth or fame; Whether inferior mischiefs be thy boast, 215 A petty tyrant rifling Gambia's coast: 16 Or bolder carnage track thy crimson way, Kings disposses'd, and Provinces thy prey; Panting to tame wide earth's remotest bound; All Cortez murder'd, all Columbus found; 220 O'er plunder'd realms to reign, detested Lord, Make millions wretched, and thyself abhorr'd;---- In Reason's eye, in Wisdom's fair account, Your sum of glory boasts a like amount; The means may differ, but the end's the same; 225 Conquest is pillage with a nobler name. Who makes the sum of human blessings less, Or sinks the stock of general happiness, No solid fame shall grace, no true renown, His life shall blazon, or his memory crown. 230 Had those advent'rous spirits who explore Thro' ocean's trackless wastes, the far-sought shore; 17 Whether of wealth insatiate, or of pow'r, Conquerors who waste, or ruffians who devour: Had these possess'd, O COOK! thy gentle mind, 235 Thy love of arts, thy love of humankind; Had these pursued thy mild and liberal plan, DISCOVERERS had not been a curse to man! The, bless'd Philanthropy! thy social hands Had link'd dissever'd worlds in brothers bands; 240 Careless, if colour, or if clime divide; Then, lov'd, and loving, man had liv'd, and died. The purest wreaths which hang on glory's shrine, For empires founded, peaceful PENN! are thine; No blood-stain'd laurels crown'd thy virtuous toil, 245 No slaughter'd natives drench'd thy fair-earn'd soil. Still thy meek spirit in thy * flock survives, Consistent still, their doctrines rule their lives; * The Quakers have emancipated all their slaves throughout America. 18 Thy followers only have effac'd the shame Inscrib'd by SLAVERY on the Christian name. 250 Shall Britain, where the soul of freedom reigns, Forge chains for others she herself disdains? Forbid it, Heaven! O let the nations know The liberty she loves she will bestow; Not to herself the glorious gift confin'd, 255 She spreads the blessing wide as humankind; And, scorning narrow views of time and place, Bids all be free in earth's extended space. What page of human annals can record A deed so bright as human rights restor'd? 260 O may that god-like deed, that shining page, Redeem OUR fame, and consecrate OUR age! And see, the cherub Mercy from above, Descending softly, quits the sphere of love! 19 On feeling hearts she sheds celestial dew, 265 And breathes her spirit o'er th' enlighten'd few; From soul to soul the spreading influence steals, Till every breast the soft contagion feels. She bears, exulting, to the burning shore The loveliest office Angel ever bore; 270 To vindicate the pow'r in Heaven ador'd, To still the clank of chains, and sheathe the sword; To cheer the mourner, and with soothing hands From bursting hearts unbind th' Oppressor's bands; To raise the lustre of the Christian name, 275 And clear the foulest blot that dims its fame. As the mild Spirit hovers o'er the coast, A fresher hue the wither'd landscapes boast; Her healing smiles the ruin'd scenes repair, And blasted Nature wears a joyous air. 280 20 She spreads her blest commission from above, Stamp'd with the sacred characters of love; She tears the banner stain'd with blood and tears, And, LIBERTY! thy shining standard rears! As the bright ensign's glory she displays, 285 See pale OPPRESSION faints beneath the blaze! The giant dies! no more his frown appals, The chain untouch'd, drops off; the fetter falls. Astonish'd echo tells the vocal shore, Opression's fall'n, and Slavery is no more! 290 The dusky myriads crowd the sultry plain, And hail that mercy long invok'd in vain. Victorious Pow'r! she bursts their two-fold bands, And FAITH and FREEDOM spring from Mercy's hands.

As the mild Spirit hovers o'er the coast, A fresher hue the wither'd landscapes boast; Her healing smiles the ruin'd scenes repair, And blasted Nature wears a joyous air. 280 20 She spreads her blest commission from above, Stamp'd with the sacred characters of love; She tears the banner stain'd with blood and tears, And, LIBERTY! thy shining standard rears! As the bright ensign's glory she displays, 285 See pale OPPRESSION faints beneath the blaze! The giant dies! no more his frown appals, The chain untouch'd, drops off; the fetter falls. Astonish'd echo tells the vocal shore, Opression's fall'n, and Slavery is no more! 290 The dusky myriads crowd the sultry plain, And hail that mercy long invok'd in vain. Victorious Pow'r! she bursts their two-fold bands, And FAITH and FREEDOM spring from Mercy's hands.

BY ANNA LETITIA BARBAULD. LONDON: PRINTED FOR J. JOHNSON, NO 72, ST. PAULS CHURCH-YARD. M.DCC.XCI. EPISTLE TO WILLIAM WILBERFORCE, ESQ. CEASE, Wilberforce, to urge thy generous aim! Thy Country knows the sin, and stands the shame! The Preacher, Poet, Senator in vain Has rattled in her sight the Negro's chain; [ 6 ] With his deep groans assail'd her startled ear, And rent the veil that hid his constant tear; Forc'd her averted eyes his stripes to scan, Beneath the bloody scourge laid bare the man, Claimed Pity's tear, urged Conscience' strong controul, And flash'd conviction on her shrinking soul. The Muse, too soon awaked, with ready tongue At Mercy's shrine applausive peans rung; And Freedom's eager sons, in vain foretold A new Astrean reign, an age of gold: She knows and she persists—Still Afric bleeds, Uncheck'd, the human traffic still proceeds; She stamps her infamy to future time, And on her harden'd forehead seals the crime. [ 7 ] In vain, to thy white standard gathering round, Wit, Worth, and Parts and Eloquence are found: In vain, to push to birth thy great design, Contending chiefs, and hostile virtues join; All, from conflicting ranks, of power possest To rouse, to melt, or to inform the breast. Where seasoned tools of Avarice prevail, A Nation's eloquence, combined, must fail: Each flimsy sophistry by turns they try; The plausive argument, the daring lye, The artful gloss, that moral sense confounds, Th' acknowledged thirst of gain that honour wounds: Bane of ingenuous minds, th' unfeeling sneer, Which, sudden, turns to stone the falling tear: [ 8 ] They search assiduous, with inverted skill, For forms of wrong, and precedents of ill; With impious mockery wrest the sacred page, And glean up crimes from each remoter age: Wrung Nature's tortures, shuddering, while you tell, From scoffing fiends bursts forth the laugh of hell; In Britain's senate, Misery's pangs give birth To jests unseemly, and to horrid mirth— Forbear!—thy virtues but provoke our doom, And swell th' account of vengeance yet to come; For, not unmarked in Heaven's impartial plan, Shall man, proud worm, contemn his fellow-man? And injur'd Afric, by herself redrest, Darts her own serpents at her Tyrant's breast. [ 9 ] Each vice, to minds deprav'd by bondage known, With sure contagion fastens on his own; In sickly languors melts his nerveless frame, And blows to rage impetuous Passion's flame: Fermenting swift, the fiery venom gains The milky innocence of infant veins; There swells the stubborn will, damps learning's fire, The whirlwind wakes of uncontroul'd desire, Sears the young heart to images of woe, And blasts the buds of Virtue as they blow. Lo! where reclin'd, pale Beauty courts the breeze, Diffus'd on sofas of voluptuous ease; With anxious awe, her menial train around, Catch her faint whispers of half-utter'd sound; [ 10 ] See her, in monstrous fellowship, unite At once the Scythian, and the Sybarite; Blending repugnant vices, misally'd, Which frugal nature purpos'd to divide; See her, with indolence to fierceness join'd, Of body delicate, infirm of mind, With languid tones imperious mandates urge; With arm recumbent wield the household scourge; And with unruffled mien, and placid sounds, Contriving torture, and inflicting wounds. Nor, in their palmy walks and spicy groves, The form benign of rural Pleasure roves; No milk-maid's song, or hum of village talk, Sooths the lone poet in his evening walk: [ 11 ] No willing arm the flail unweary'd plies, Where the mix'd sounds of cheerful labour rise; No blooming maids, and frolic swains are seen To pay gay homage to their harvest queen: No heart-expanding scenes their eyes must prove Of thriving industry, and faithful love: But shrieks and yells disturb the balmy air, Dumb sullen looks of woe announce despair, And angry eyes thro' dusky features glare. Far from the sounding lash the Muses fly, And sensual riot drowns each finer joy. Nor less from the gay East, on essenc'd wings, Breathing unnam'd perfumes, Contagion springs; [ 12 ] The soft luxurious plague alike pervades The marble palaces, and rural shades; Hence throng'd Augusta builds her rosy bowers, And decks in summer wreaths her smoky towers; And hence, in summer bow'rs, Art's costly hand Pours courtly splendours o'er the dazzled land: The manners melt—One undistinguish'd blaze O'erwhelms the sober pomp of elder days; Corruption follows with gigantic stride, And scarce vouchsafes his shameless front to hide: The spreading leprosy taints ev'ry part, Infects each limb, and sickens at the heart. Simplicity! most dear of rural maids, Weeping resigns her violated shades: [ 13 ] Stern Independence from his glebe retires, And anxious Freedom eyes her drooping fires; By foreign wealth are British morals chang'd, And Afric's sons, and India's, smile aveng'd. For you, whose temper'd ardour long has borne Untir'd the labour, and unmov'd the scorn; In Virtue's fasti be inscrib'd your fame, And utter'd your's with Howard's honour'd name, Friends of the friendless—Hail, ye generous band! Whose efforts yet arrest Heav'n's lifted hand, Around whose steady brows, in union bright, The civic wreath, and Christian's palm unite: [ 14 ] Your merit stands, no greater and no less, Without, or with the varnish of success; But seek no more to break a Nation's fall, For ye have sav'd yourselves—and that is all. Succeeding times your struggles, and their fate, With mingled shame and triumph shall relate, While faithful History, in her various page, Marking the features of this motley age, To shed a glory, and to fix a stain, Tells how you strove, and that you strove in vain.

2,Card_1792_1.txt,"A POEM ON THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE. ADDRESSED TO HER OWN SEX. BY M. BIRKETT. ""DISGUISE THYSELF AS THOU WILT, STILL, SLA- ""VERY, STILL THOU ART A BITTER CUP."" STERNE. THE SECOND EDITION. DUBLIN: PRINTED BY J. JONES, NO. 111, GRAFTON-STREET. M,DCC,XCII. PREFACE IN presenting this juvenile attempt to the eyes of the public, I am sensible how much I lay myself open to the censure of those, whose superior discernment shall point out all its er- rors in their full magnitude.—I can only hope that the merits of the cause will in part plead my excuse; for the rest, I submit to their candor. It is with the greatest diffidence that I pre- sume to offer, to indiscriminate inspection, a production of so little labour, which never ex- perienced the correcting hand of judgment, and which, overwhelmed with confusion, would shrink from the piercing eye of criticism—as the owl from the face of day. M. B. A POEM ON THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE. OPPRESSION! thou, whose hard and cruel chain, Entails on all thy victims woe and pain; Who gives with tyrant force and scorpion whip, The cup of mis'ry to a Negro's lip; Marks with stern frown thy wide, unhallow'd reign, And broods with gloomy wing o'er Afric's injur'd plain! ( 2 ) Thy voice which spreads pale desolation round, While trembling myriads groan beneath the sound, Thy voice more rude than Boreas' chilling breath, Calls thousands forth to feel a living death! Which in hoarse thunders bids injustice rise! While oft beneath the strokes the suff'rer dies: Yes! thy infernal voice impels my song, And o'er my soul its crude ideas throng; A sorrowing sympathy surrounds my heart, And mild compassion bleeds in every part. Mov'd at the dire distress my brethren know My mind in vain participates their woe; In vain for them I raise the fervent sigh; Ah! still they bleed!—they languish!—still they die! How little think the giddy and the gay While sipping o'er the sweets of charming tea, How oft with grief they pierce the manly breast, How oft their lux'ry robs the wretch of rest, And that to gain the plant we idly waste Th'extreme of human mis'ry they must taste! Yes! 'tis no lying fable I relate, Th'extreme of human mis'ry is their fate! ( 3 ) Let sordid traders call it what they will, Men must be men, possest with feelings still; And little boots a white or sable skin, To prove a fair inhabitant within. There are, oh! scandal to the Christian name, Who fierce of blood, and lost to sense of shame, Dare lave their hands impious in human gore, And barter living souls for lust of ore; More rav'nous than the foulest beasts of prey, They but from Nature's powerful cravings slay; More cruel than the thief, whose murd'rous knife At once deprives the trembling wretch of life: Him poverty, perchance, first taught to stray, And strongly urg'd her too prevailing plea; Yet him the justice of our laws condemn: Beasts we destroy, but seldom think of them. Strange paradox! we view with shrinking eye, The murd'rer's crime, and bid him justly die; But when our traders snatch a thousand lives, No pain, no punishment on them derives; The guilt's diminish'd, as increas'd its size, And they are clear—at least in mortal eyes. ( 4 ) Tell me, ye friends of slav'ry's shameful cause, Where shall I find the records—where the laws, Which give to man indubitable power To sell his brother, and the spoil devour? And whence do we th'infernal doctrine hold, To sell th'image of our God for gold? To our first parents when th'Almighty Cause Reveal'd his holy will—his hallow'd laws; When from his lips the wondrous accents broke, And mortals listen'd while the Godhead spoke; In that mysterious moment did he say? - "" Man shall his fellow ravage, sell, and slay; "" And one unhappy race shall always be "" Slave to another's pamper'd luxury."" There are, I know, who think and more who say, That not so injur'd—so opprest are they; That under master's just they earn their bread, And plenty crowns the board at which they're fed. Ah, sophist, vain thy subtle reas'ning's aim! Look at the Negro's sun-burnt, grief-worn frame! Examine well each limb, each nerve, each bone, Each artery—and then observe thy own; ( 5 ) The beating pulse, the heart that throbs within, All, (save the sable tincture of his skin,) Say, Christians, do they not resemble you? If so, their feelings and sensations too: One moment now with you his burthen rest, Then tell me, is he happy—is he blest? Lo! where on Afric's shore the sable youth, Feels each degree of honor, love, and truth; (Though he ne'er heard the gospel's joyful sound, Nor call'd on Jesus in his natal ground; Reproach him not, oh, follower of thy Lord, Who never knew the blessing of his word; Think on thy own forefathers savage lore, He keeps his inward guide, and dost thou more?) Rear'd in the lap of innocence and ease, Him simple Nature's genuine bounties please. For him no palace rears its costly head, Contented with an humble turf-built shed; On him no fawning lacqueys proudly wait, In all the pamper'd insolence of state; No harmless lives, his taste to gratify, Opprest with various torture slowly die. ( 6 ) And if his manners suit the savage name, Uneducated man is every where the same. There in that plain, when freedom was his guest, And social love glow'd in his faithful breast; Then when his soul youth's joyous feelings knew, And manhood, ripening manhood, rose to view; He to his parents eye perhaps appears, The only staff of their declining years; And he with ceaseless love and anxious care, Does oft for them the hunted food prepare: Perchance soft passion does his bosom move, And his fond nymph returns his constant love; Perhaps his offspring hail their honour'd sire, And each to gain the envy'd kiss aspire: On him a pleasing weight of cares attend, As father, husband, brother, son or friend: Haply the hour when their supply he sought, His soul with ev'ry warm affection fraught, As o'er the plain he chac'd his wonted prey, And hope deceitful cheer'd the toilsome way; When homeward now the lifeless prize he brought, Already greets the cot his rapid thought; ( 7 ) Him Christian traders see, his path surround, In vain his feet pursue their nimble bound; He's seiz'd and dragg'd along—in vain he cries, Starts, stamps the ground—now groans, now weeps, now sighs; And fill'd with all the agony of grief, Raves with despair—now supplicates relief: In vain he strives their pity to command, The ruffians hear, but will not understand; Deaf to th'heart-rending groan, the plaintive sigh, They view his misery with a stoic eye, And to the vessel haul the wretch along In chains to mingle with the suffering throng. Oh thou! whom more than all he loves beside, Friend of his heart! his chaste and faithful bride! What was thy anguish on that fatal day Which bore thy spouse from Afric far away! In vain for him thou heap'st the chearful fire; In vain thy little ones demand their sire; In vain thou chid'st his long delay!—go, mourn, For never must the youth thou lov'st return! ( 8 ) Lo, now the winds embrace the swelling sail, And the full bark salutes the rising gale; While now the desolated shore they leave, And for Jamaica cut the briny wave. While o'er the foaming sea their course they steal, Think what the Negroes suffer!—what they feel! Opprest with sickness, close confin'd they lie, No kind, no sympathising friend is nigh: Grim Death his jaws insatiate shews around, And bleeding Mem'ry opes the recent wound. Thrice happy they who feel his icy hand! No more they dread their tyrant's stern command; No more expos'd to insult and to pain, They drag along the hard and cruel chain; But their freed souls approach the throne of grace, To meet the proud oppressor face to face. Oh, tyrants, what will then your anguish be, When God and men shall your injustice see! And trust me that important day will come, Which fixes your irrevocable doom, When all your basely murder'd slaves shall rise, And publish all your crimes throughout the skies. ( 9 ) Here cease, oh Muse! nor dare the secret tell, The dread event, which but with God must dwell. Now turn our eye to India's sultry shore, And tell, oh! tell me, are their sorrows o'er? The bark arrives, with those who yet remain, They drag to land the feebly tott'ring train: Their squalid look, and meagre form declare The soul opprest with sickness, grief and care. I pass the complicated scenes of woe Which these sad vassals of our lux'ry know: Their sickness, fatt'ning, shameful market, past, And now for life the dreadful die is cast. Grant a mild master kindly treats them well, (Few such there are—and they who know can tell); Grant that those masters plenteous meals prepare, (Though well 'tis known their food is scant and bare); Yet then, even then, can comfort on them wait, Depress'd, degraded to a servile state? And they once chieftans in their native land, Shackled, in chains, and trembling at command; ( 10 ) Naked, exposed to Phoebus' piercing beams, And yok'd (as horse or oxen) to the teams; Dead to remorse, the overseer stands by, And oft does he the sounding lash apply. So Pharaoh's task-masters of yore opprest Old Jacob's seed—and thus the flock distrest. Now dead to hope they see resistance vain, They in their manly breasts conceal their pain; A silent grief to furious rage succeeds, And by resentment stung—their whole soul bleeds. Firm in despair their hands refuse the yoke, We call them stubborn—and apply the stroke; Their reeking backs the dire correction shew, Yet they unmov'd, nor fear nor tremor know; Their strength heroic claims a nobler name, And shews not their's—but their oppressor's shame. Say not, that if not humbled they rebel; Tyrant! the cause, the guilt with thee must dwell; For when they view the authors of their woe, No wonder if fierce passion aims the blow! They all their blasted hopes and comforts see, Condemn'd to linger life in misery. ( 11 ) What son of thine, oh Albion, would bow down, Would tremble at the upstart planter's frown? What son of thine, oh Albion, thus opprest, Nor feel revenge inflame his haughty breast? They not the joys of mild Religion know, The ransom'd soul they to a Saviour owe. For this, oh Britain, shall I dare to blame, Nor can I with the Turk enrol thy name. The Turk to Mah'met would convert his slave; He gives him freedom and his soul would save: The Spaniards to the mine their vassals send, But first the rites of baptism them attend: Our Albion, when opprest her captives lie, Shews not the way to suffer and to die; Nor gives the gospel to each erring mind, Nor points to Jesus merciful and kind. Ah, Negro, think not hardly of our God, Tho' high o'er thee affliction lifts her rod; Ill do his followers ways his goodness prove, Whose laws breathe mercy and whose precepts love; And ill our manners with our maxims suit, These dignify—while those degrade us to the brute. ( 12 ) Lysander, did I really hear thee say, Self-preservation bids us on them prey, Or what vast nation could supply the bread, For such encreasing myriads to be fed! Think'st thou that form'd on this erroneous plan The world was made—and God's last, best work— man? Think'st thou that He who erst seven thousand fill'd, With what a few small loaves and fishes yield, Think'st thou he's insufficient to supply, Who hears the tender raven's croaking cry? ""Must we abandon then, Camillus cries, ""The wealth abundant which in Afric lies? ""Shall our fam'd commerce languish and decay, ""And we no more send fleets for slaves away?"" No, wise Camillus, search her fertile land, Let the mild rays of commerce there expand; Her plains abound in ore, in fruits her soil, And the rich plain scarce needs the ploughman's toil; Thy vessels crown'd with olive branches send, And make each injur'd African thy friend: ( 13 ) So tides of wealth by peace and justice got, Oh, philanthropic heart! will be thy lot. Plant there our colonies, and to their soul, Declare the God who form'd this boundless whole; Improve their manners—teach them how to live, To them the useful lore of science give; So shall with us their praise and glory rest, And we in blessing be supremely blest; For 'tis a duty which we surely owe, We to the Romans were what to us Afric now. Hibernian fair, who own compassion's sway, Scorn not a younger sister's artless lay; To you the Muse would raise her daring song, For Mercy's softest beams to you belong; To you the sympathetic sigh is known, And Charity's sweet lustre—all your own; To you gall'd Mis'ry seldom pleads in vain, Oh, let us rise and burst the Negro's chain! Yes, sisters, yes, to us the task belongs, 'Tis we increase or mitigate their wrongs. If we the produce of their toils refuse, If we no more the blood-stain'd lux'ry choose; ( 14 ) If from our lips we push the plant away For which the liberties of thousands pay, Of thousands once as blest, and born as free, And nurs'd with care, (tho' not so soft,) as we; If in benev'lence firm, we this can dare, And in our brethrens sufferings hold no share, In no small part their long-borne pangs will cease, And we to souls unborn may whisper peace. Sisters! another theme, did fancy choose, Far from your view had shrunk my blushing Muse; And still from you conceal'd my trembling form, But here—I must, I dare, I will be warm - Shall we who dwell in pleasure, peace and ease, Shall we who but in meekness, mildness please, Shall we surrounded by each dear delight, To soothe the heart, or gratify the sight, Say, shall for us the sable sufferers sigh? Say, shall for us so many victims die? Shall still for us the sable maid bewail? Shall still the doating parent's fondness fail? Shall groans for ever ring thro' Afric's grove, Of deep distess and disappointed love? ( 15 ) Oh, how would thorns of care enthral each breast, How would it rob the passing hours of rest, If from our arms our nearest kindred torn, And we for ever doom'd their loss to mourn? No, let Ierne's gentle daughters prove The kindling force of sympathetic love; Now shew their virtues, be humane indeed, And plead for those ""who have no power to plead."" Say not that small's the sphere in which we move, And our attempts would vain and fruitless prove; Not so—we hold a most important share, In all the evils—all the wrongs they bear, And tho' their woes entire we can't remove, We may th'increasing mis'ries which they prove, Push far away the plant for which they die, And in this one small thing our taste deny; We must, we ought, 'tis Justice points the way; Mercy and Charity loudly call—""obey."" Can you refuse to soothe, methinks they cry, The heart of sorrow, or bid cease the sigh? Can you whom plenty, wealth and peace surround, Who in society's mild joys abound? ( 16 ) Commerce to you does its choice stores impart, With all the gifts of Nature and of Art; For you gay Flora animates the scene, And spreads with vast parterres the smiling green; Her mingled pow'rs and varied charms unite, And does each sense—not satiate but delight; On you brown Ceres sheds her richest powers, Pomona's fruits nectareous—all are yours; For you Hygeia, maid of blooming mien, With joy abounding, fills the mirthful scene; Can you whose hearts these heav'n-crown'd blessings feel, Refuse one sacrifice their wounds to heal? A plant of which 'tis lux'ry gives the use, Which our sad brethrens slav'ry does produce! No, daughters of Ierne, you will give This self-denying proof and bid them live! See where Religion's holy banners rise, And to your view presents immortal skies! List, for methinks I hear the Matron say, Can you whose hearts confess my hallow'd sway; Can you before my altar bow the knee, And yet refuse to set a brother free? ( 17 ) In humble faith you hope for heaven's high crown, Yet press with grief so many spirits down: ""Preserve us, Lord, from evil,"" can you pray, Yet wilfully pursue the evil way? And how can you his blessing think to prove, Whose first, best law is universal love? Man was his fav'rite work—he form'd him free; His fav'rite work whate'er his colour be; And far more dark's the sinful soul within, Than the poor harmless Negro's sable skin. ""Strange!"" cries Flavilla, ""if so foul the trade, ""Why has wise heaven its thunders thus delay'd? ""And if the traffic of mankind were wrong, ""Would heaven's dread Lord have suffer'd it so long? ""Sure rather he'd his sore displeasure shew, ""And crush the tyrants 'neath his vengeful blow."" Shalt thou, Flavilla, with too curious eye, In his mysterious causes dare to pry? Shalt thou, short-sighted mortal, wish to know, Why thus thy Maker orders things below? Ask why the thief who steals thy purse away, Still feels the warm reviving light of day? ( 18 ) Ask why the wretch who lifts the murd'ring knife, (Escap'd thy search) still breathes the air of life? Or, ask why he who robs the houseless poor, In safety yet enjoys his ill-got store? Or why throughout the globe's capacious round, Virtue oft droops where Vice is prosp'rous found? Seek not the hidden ways of God to know, Sure is his justice though 'tis often slow. Enough for us—his mercy suffers long, And man's free will may chuse or right or wrong; His sacred judgments are reserv'd in store, 'Tis ours to chuse the right—and silently adore. Oh! may that Power, whose wondrous wisdom wrought Myriads of worlds, with beauteous order fraught, Whose fingers gave to heav'n's wide arch its bound, And scatter'd those fair orbs which glitter round; Who bade the moon to shine each night—each day The sun to cheer us by his vital ray; At whose command the rolling thunders rise, And livid lightnings flash through blazing skies, Whose word creative peopled earth with charms, Whose grace preserves us and whose bounty warms: ( 19 ) May the mild dictates of his love impart The path of virtue to each wand'ring heart! Before him flee the mists of error blind, And Truth's whole force irradiates all the mind. So when Aurora through the gates of night, Leads forth the ruddy blaze of opening light, Bursts o'er the horizon with golden fire, And bids the hovering shades of night expire; Her foot-steps chase the sable clouds away, And usher in the glorious light of day.

PREFACE IN presenting this juvenile attempt to the eyes of the public, I am sensible how much I lay myself open to the censure of those, whose superior discernment shall point out all its er- rors in their full magnitude.—I can only hope that the merits of the cause will in part plead my excuse; for the rest, I submit to their candor. It is with the greatest diffidence that I pre- sume to offer, to indiscriminate inspection, a production of so little labour, which never ex- perienced the correcting hand of judgment, and which, overwhelmed with confusion, would shrink from the piercing eye of criticism—as the owl from the face of day. M. B. A POEM ON THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE. OPPRESSION! thou, whose hard and cruel chain, Entails on all thy victims woe and pain; Who gives with tyrant force and scorpion whip, The cup of mis'ry to a Negro's lip; Marks with stern frown thy wide, unhallow'd reign, And broods with gloomy wing o'er Afric's injur'd plain! ( 2 ) Thy voice which spreads pale desolation round, While trembling myriads groan beneath the sound, Thy voice more rude than Boreas' chilling breath, Calls thousands forth to feel a living death! Which in hoarse thunders bids injustice rise! While oft beneath the strokes the suff'rer dies: Yes! thy infernal voice impels my song, And o'er my soul its crude ideas throng; A sorrowing sympathy surrounds my heart, And mild compassion bleeds in every part. Mov'd at the dire distress my brethren know My mind in vain participates their woe; In vain for them I raise the fervent sigh; Ah! still they bleed!—they languish!—still they die! How little think the giddy and the gay While sipping o'er the sweets of charming tea, How oft with grief they pierce the manly breast, How oft their lux'ry robs the wretch of rest, And that to gain the plant we idly waste Th'extreme of human mis'ry they must taste! Yes! 'tis no lying fable I relate, Th'extreme of human mis'ry is their fate! ( 3 ) Let sordid traders call it what they will, Men must be men, possest with feelings still; And little boots a white or sable skin, To prove a fair inhabitant within. There are, oh! scandal to the Christian name, Who fierce of blood, and lost to sense of shame, Dare lave their hands impious in human gore, And barter living souls for lust of ore; More rav'nous than the foulest beasts of prey, They but from Nature's powerful cravings slay; More cruel than the thief, whose murd'rous knife At once deprives the trembling wretch of life: Him poverty, perchance, first taught to stray, And strongly urg'd her too prevailing plea; Yet him the justice of our laws condemn: Beasts we destroy, but seldom think of them. Strange paradox! we view with shrinking eye, The murd'rer's crime, and bid him justly die; But when our traders snatch a thousand lives, No pain, no punishment on them derives; The guilt's diminish'd, as increas'd its size, And they are clear—at least in mortal eyes. ( 4 ) Tell me, ye friends of slav'ry's shameful cause, Where shall I find the records—where the laws, Which give to man indubitable power To sell his brother, and the spoil devour? And whence do we th'infernal doctrine hold, To sell th'image of our God for gold? To our first parents when th'Almighty Cause Reveal'd his holy will—his hallow'd laws; When from his lips the wondrous accents broke, And mortals listen'd while the Godhead spoke; In that mysterious moment did he say? - "" Man shall his fellow ravage, sell, and slay; "" And one unhappy race shall always be "" Slave to another's pamper'd luxury."" There are, I know, who think and more who say, That not so injur'd—so opprest are they; That under master's just they earn their bread, And plenty crowns the board at which they're fed. Ah, sophist, vain thy subtle reas'ning's aim! Look at the Negro's sun-burnt, grief-worn frame! Examine well each limb, each nerve, each bone, Each artery—and then observe thy own; ( 5 ) The beating pulse, the heart that throbs within, All, (save the sable tincture of his skin,) Say, Christians, do they not resemble you? If so, their feelings and sensations too: One moment now with you his burthen rest, Then tell me, is he happy—is he blest? Lo! where on Afric's shore the sable youth, Feels each degree of honor, love, and truth; (Though he ne'er heard the gospel's joyful sound, Nor call'd on Jesus in his natal ground; Reproach him not, oh, follower of thy Lord, Who never knew the blessing of his word; Think on thy own forefathers savage lore, He keeps his inward guide, and dost thou more?) Rear'd in the lap of innocence and ease, Him simple Nature's genuine bounties please. For him no palace rears its costly head, Contented with an humble turf-built shed; On him no fawning lacqueys proudly wait, In all the pamper'd insolence of state; No harmless lives, his taste to gratify, Opprest with various torture slowly die. ( 6 ) And if his manners suit the savage name, Uneducated man is every where the same. There in that plain, when freedom was his guest, And social love glow'd in his faithful breast; Then when his soul youth's joyous feelings knew, And manhood, ripening manhood, rose to view; He to his parents eye perhaps appears, The only staff of their declining years; And he with ceaseless love and anxious care, Does oft for them the hunted food prepare: Perchance soft passion does his bosom move, And his fond nymph returns his constant love; Perhaps his offspring hail their honour'd sire, And each to gain the envy'd kiss aspire: On him a pleasing weight of cares attend, As father, husband, brother, son or friend: Haply the hour when their supply he sought, His soul with ev'ry warm affection fraught, As o'er the plain he chac'd his wonted prey, And hope deceitful cheer'd the toilsome way; When homeward now the lifeless prize he brought, Already greets the cot his rapid thought; ( 7 ) Him Christian traders see, his path surround, In vain his feet pursue their nimble bound; He's seiz'd and dragg'd along—in vain he cries, Starts, stamps the ground—now groans, now weeps, now sighs; And fill'd with all the agony of grief, Raves with despair—now supplicates relief: In vain he strives their pity to command, The ruffians hear, but will not understand; Deaf to th'heart-rending groan, the plaintive sigh, They view his misery with a stoic eye, And to the vessel haul the wretch along In chains to mingle with the suffering throng. Oh thou! whom more than all he loves beside, Friend of his heart! his chaste and faithful bride! What was thy anguish on that fatal day Which bore thy spouse from Afric far away! In vain for him thou heap'st the chearful fire; In vain thy little ones demand their sire; In vain thou chid'st his long delay!—go, mourn, For never must the youth thou lov'st return! ( 8 ) Lo, now the winds embrace the swelling sail, And the full bark salutes the rising gale; While now the desolated shore they leave, And for Jamaica cut the briny wave. While o'er the foaming sea their course they steal, Think what the Negroes suffer!—what they feel! Opprest with sickness, close confin'd they lie, No kind, no sympathising friend is nigh: Grim Death his jaws insatiate shews around, And bleeding Mem'ry opes the recent wound. Thrice happy they who feel his icy hand! No more they dread their tyrant's stern command; No more expos'd to insult and to pain, They drag along the hard and cruel chain; But their freed souls approach the throne of grace, To meet the proud oppressor face to face. Oh, tyrants, what will then your anguish be, When God and men shall your injustice see! And trust me that important day will come, Which fixes your irrevocable doom, When all your basely murder'd slaves shall rise, And publish all your crimes throughout the skies. ( 9 ) Here cease, oh Muse! nor dare the secret tell, The dread event, which but with God must dwell. Now turn our eye to India's sultry shore, And tell, oh! tell me, are their sorrows o'er? The bark arrives, with those who yet remain, They drag to land the feebly tott'ring train: Their squalid look, and meagre form declare The soul opprest with sickness, grief and care. I pass the complicated scenes of woe Which these sad vassals of our lux'ry know: Their sickness, fatt'ning, shameful market, past, And now for life the dreadful die is cast. Grant a mild master kindly treats them well, (Few such there are—and they who know can tell); Grant that those masters plenteous meals prepare, (Though well 'tis known their food is scant and bare); Yet then, even then, can comfort on them wait, Depress'd, degraded to a servile state? And they once chieftans in their native land, Shackled, in chains, and trembling at command; ( 10 ) Naked, exposed to Phoebus' piercing beams, And yok'd (as horse or oxen) to the teams; Dead to remorse, the overseer stands by, And oft does he the sounding lash apply. So Pharaoh's task-masters of yore opprest Old Jacob's seed—and thus the flock distrest. Now dead to hope they see resistance vain, They in their manly breasts conceal their pain; A silent grief to furious rage succeeds, And by resentment stung—their whole soul bleeds. Firm in despair their hands refuse the yoke, We call them stubborn—and apply the stroke; Their reeking backs the dire correction shew, Yet they unmov'd, nor fear nor tremor know; Their strength heroic claims a nobler name, And shews not their's—but their oppressor's shame. Say not, that if not humbled they rebel; Tyrant! the cause, the guilt with thee must dwell; For when they view the authors of their woe, No wonder if fierce passion aims the blow! They all their blasted hopes and comforts see, Condemn'd to linger life in misery. ( 11 ) What son of thine, oh Albion, would bow down, Would tremble at the upstart planter's frown? What son of thine, oh Albion, thus opprest, Nor feel revenge inflame his haughty breast? They not the joys of mild Religion know, The ransom'd soul they to a Saviour owe. For this, oh Britain, shall I dare to blame, Nor can I with the Turk enrol thy name. The Turk to Mah'met would convert his slave; He gives him freedom and his soul would save: The Spaniards to the mine their vassals send, But first the rites of baptism them attend: Our Albion, when opprest her captives lie, Shews not the way to suffer and to die; Nor gives the gospel to each erring mind, Nor points to Jesus merciful and kind. Ah, Negro, think not hardly of our God, Tho' high o'er thee affliction lifts her rod; Ill do his followers ways his goodness prove, Whose laws breathe mercy and whose precepts love; And ill our manners with our maxims suit, These dignify—while those degrade us to the brute. ( 12 ) Lysander, did I really hear thee say, Self-preservation bids us on them prey, Or what vast nation could supply the bread, For such encreasing myriads to be fed! Think'st thou that form'd on this erroneous plan The world was made—and God's last, best work— man? Think'st thou that He who erst seven thousand fill'd, With what a few small loaves and fishes yield, Think'st thou he's insufficient to supply, Who hears the tender raven's croaking cry? ""Must we abandon then, Camillus cries, ""The wealth abundant which in Afric lies? ""Shall our fam'd commerce languish and decay, ""And we no more send fleets for slaves away?"" No, wise Camillus, search her fertile land, Let the mild rays of commerce there expand; Her plains abound in ore, in fruits her soil, And the rich plain scarce needs the ploughman's toil; Thy vessels crown'd with olive branches send, And make each injur'd African thy friend: ( 13 ) So tides of wealth by peace and justice got, Oh, philanthropic heart! will be thy lot. Plant there our colonies, and to their soul, Declare the God who form'd this boundless whole; Improve their manners—teach them how to live, To them the useful lore of science give; So shall with us their praise and glory rest, And we in blessing be supremely blest; For 'tis a duty which we surely owe, We to the Romans were what to us Afric now. Hibernian fair, who own compassion's sway, Scorn not a younger sister's artless lay; To you the Muse would raise her daring song, For Mercy's softest beams to you belong; To you the sympathetic sigh is known, And Charity's sweet lustre—all your own; To you gall'd Mis'ry seldom pleads in vain, Oh, let us rise and burst the Negro's chain! Yes, sisters, yes, to us the task belongs, 'Tis we increase or mitigate their wrongs. If we the produce of their toils refuse, If we no more the blood-stain'd lux'ry choose; ( 14 ) If from our lips we push the plant away For which the liberties of thousands pay, Of thousands once as blest, and born as free, And nurs'd with care, (tho' not so soft,) as we; If in benev'lence firm, we this can dare, And in our brethrens sufferings hold no share, In no small part their long-borne pangs will cease, And we to souls unborn may whisper peace. Sisters! another theme, did fancy choose, Far from your view had shrunk my blushing Muse; And still from you conceal'd my trembling form, But here—I must, I dare, I will be warm - Shall we who dwell in pleasure, peace and ease, Shall we who but in meekness, mildness please, Shall we surrounded by each dear delight, To soothe the heart, or gratify the sight, Say, shall for us the sable sufferers sigh? Say, shall for us so many victims die? Shall still for us the sable maid bewail? Shall still the doating parent's fondness fail? Shall groans for ever ring thro' Afric's grove, Of deep distess and disappointed love? ( 15 ) Oh, how would thorns of care enthral each breast, How would it rob the passing hours of rest, If from our arms our nearest kindred torn, And we for ever doom'd their loss to mourn? No, let Ierne's gentle daughters prove The kindling force of sympathetic love; Now shew their virtues, be humane indeed, And plead for those ""who have no power to plead."" Say not that small's the sphere in which we move, And our attempts would vain and fruitless prove; Not so—we hold a most important share, In all the evils—all the wrongs they bear, And tho' their woes entire we can't remove, We may th'increasing mis'ries which they prove, Push far away the plant for which they die, And in this one small thing our taste deny; We must, we ought, 'tis Justice points the way; Mercy and Charity loudly call—""obey."" Can you refuse to soothe, methinks they cry, The heart of sorrow, or bid cease the sigh? Can you whom plenty, wealth and peace surround, Who in society's mild joys abound? ( 16 ) Commerce to you does its choice stores impart, With all the gifts of Nature and of Art; For you gay Flora animates the scene, And spreads with vast parterres the smiling green; Her mingled pow'rs and varied charms unite, And does each sense—not satiate but delight; On you brown Ceres sheds her richest powers, Pomona's fruits nectareous—all are yours; For you Hygeia, maid of blooming mien, With joy abounding, fills the mirthful scene; Can you whose hearts these heav'n-crown'd blessings feel, Refuse one sacrifice their wounds to heal? A plant of which 'tis lux'ry gives the use, Which our sad brethrens slav'ry does produce! No, daughters of Ierne, you will give This self-denying proof and bid them live! See where Religion's holy banners rise, And to your view presents immortal skies! List, for methinks I hear the Matron say, Can you whose hearts confess my hallow'd sway; Can you before my altar bow the knee, And yet refuse to set a brother free? ( 17 ) In humble faith you hope for heaven's high crown, Yet press with grief so many spirits down: ""Preserve us, Lord, from evil,"" can you pray, Yet wilfully pursue the evil way? And how can you his blessing think to prove, Whose first, best law is universal love? Man was his fav'rite work—he form'd him free; His fav'rite work whate'er his colour be; And far more dark's the sinful soul within, Than the poor harmless Negro's sable skin. ""Strange!"" cries Flavilla, ""if so foul the trade, ""Why has wise heaven its thunders thus delay'd? ""And if the traffic of mankind were wrong, ""Would heaven's dread Lord have suffer'd it so long? ""Sure rather he'd his sore displeasure shew, ""And crush the tyrants 'neath his vengeful blow."" Shalt thou, Flavilla, with too curious eye, In his mysterious causes dare to pry? Shalt thou, short-sighted mortal, wish to know, Why thus thy Maker orders things below? Ask why the thief who steals thy purse away, Still feels the warm reviving light of day? ( 18 ) Ask why the wretch who lifts the murd'ring knife, (Escap'd thy search) still breathes the air of life? Or, ask why he who robs the houseless poor, In safety yet enjoys his ill-got store? Or why throughout the globe's capacious round, Virtue oft droops where Vice is prosp'rous found? Seek not the hidden ways of God to know, Sure is his justice though 'tis often slow. Enough for us—his mercy suffers long, And man's free will may chuse or right or wrong; His sacred judgments are reserv'd in store, 'Tis ours to chuse the right—and silently adore. Oh! may that Power, whose wondrous wisdom wrought Myriads of worlds, with beauteous order fraught, Whose fingers gave to heav'n's wide arch its bound, And scatter'd those fair orbs which glitter round; Who bade the moon to shine each night—each day The sun to cheer us by his vital ray; At whose command the rolling thunders rise, And livid lightnings flash through blazing skies, Whose word creative peopled earth with charms, Whose grace preserves us and whose bounty warms: ( 19 ) May the mild dictates of his love impart The path of virtue to each wand'ring heart! Before him flee the mists of error blind, And Truth's whole force irradiates all the mind. So when Aurora through the gates of night, Leads forth the ruddy blaze of opening light, Bursts o'er the horizon with golden fire, And bids the hovering shades of night expire; Her foot-steps chase the sable clouds away, And usher in the glorious light of day.

( 3 ) ************ ************ ************ THE Sorrows of Yamba, &c. To the Tune of Hosier's Ghost. ""In St. Lucie's distant isle, Still with Afric's love I burn; Parted many a thousand mile, Never, never to return. Come, kind death! and give me rest, Yamba has no friend but thee; Thou can'st ease my throbbing breast, Thou can'st set the Prisoner free. Down my cheeks the tears are dripping, Broken is my heart with grief; Mangled my poor flesh with whipping, Come kind death! and bring relief. Born on Afric's Golden Coast, Once I was as blest as you; Parents tender I could boast, Husband dear, and children too. ( 4 ) Whity Man he came from far, Sailing o'er the briny flood, Who, with help of British Tar, Buys up human flesh and blood. With the Baby at my breast (Other two were sleeping by) In my Hut I sat at rest, With no thought of danger nigh. From the Bush at even tide Rush'd the fierce man-stealing Crew; Seiz'd the Children by my side, Seiz'd the wretched Yamba too. ************ ************ ************ Then for love of filthy Gold, Strait they bore me to the sea; Cramm'd me down a Slave Ship's hold, Where were Hundreds stow'd like me. ( 5 ) Naked on the Platform lying, Now we cross the tumbling wave; Shrieking, sickening, fainting, dying, Deed of shame for Britons brave. At the savage Captain's beck, Now like Brutes they make us prance; Smack the Cat about the Deck, And in scorn they bid us dance. Nauseous horse beans they bring nigh, Sick and sad we cannot eat; Cat must cure the Sulks they cry, Down their throats we'll force the meat. ************ ************ ************ I in groaning passed the night, And did roll my aching head; At the break of morning light, My poor Child was cold and dead. ( 6 ) Happy, happy, there she lies, ""Thou shalt feel the lash no more, Thus full many a Negro dies 'Ere we reach the destin'd shore. Thee, sweet infant, none shall sell, Thou hast gained a wat'ry Grave Clean escap'd the Tyrants fell, While thy mother lives a Slave. Driven like Cattle to a fair, See they sell us young and old; Child from Mother too they tear, All for love of filthy Gold. ************ ************ ************ I was sold to Massa hard, Some have Massas kind and good; And again my back was scarr'd, Bad and stinted was my food. ( 7 ) Poor and wounded, faint and sick, All expos'd to burning sky, Massa bids me grass to pick, And I now am near to die. What and if to death he send me, Savage murder tho' it be, British Law shall ne'er befriend me, They protect not Slaves like me."" Mourning thus my wretched state, (Ne'er may I forget the day) Once in dusk of evening late, Far from home I dar'd to stray; Dar'd, alas! with impious haste Tow'rds the roaring Sea to fly; Death itself I long'd to taste, Long'd to cast me in and Die. There I met upon the Strand English Missionary Good, He had Bible book in hand, Which poor me no understood. Led by pity from afar He had left his native ground; Thus if some inflict a scar, Others fly to cure the wound. ( 8 ) Strait he pull'd me from the shore, Bid me no self-murder do; Talk'd of state when life is o'er, All from Bible good and true. Then he led me to his Cot, Sooth'd and pity'd all my woe; Told me 'twas the Christian's lot Much to suffer here below. Told me then of God's dear Son, (Strange and wond'rous is the story;) What sad wrong to him was done, Tho' he was the Lord of Glory. Told me too, like one who knew him, (Can such love as this be true?) How he died for them that slew him, Died for wretched Yamba too. Freely he his mercy proffer'd, And to Sinners he was sent; E'en to Massa pardon's offer'd; O if Massa would repent! Wicked deed full many a time Sinful Yamba too hath done But she wails to God her crime, But she trusts his only Son. ( 9 ) O ye slaves whom Massas beat, Ye are stained with guilt within; As ye hope for mercy sweet, So forgive your Massas' sin. And with grief when sinking low, Mark the Road that Yamba trod; Think how all her pain and woe Brought the Captive home to God. Now let Yamba too adore Gracious Heaven's mysterious Plan; Now I'll count thy mercies o'er, Flowing thro' the guilt of man. Now I'll bless my cruel capture, (Hence I've known a Saviour's name) Till my Grief is turn'd to Rapture, And I half forget the blame.

( 3 ) ************ ************ ************ THE Sorrows of Yamba, &c. To the Tune of Hosier's Ghost. ""In St. Lucie's distant isle, Still with Afric's love I burn; Parted many a thousand mile, Never, never to return. Come, kind death! and give me rest, Yamba has no friend but thee; Thou can'st ease my throbbing breast, Thou can'st set the Prisoner free. Down my cheeks the tears are dripping, Broken is my heart with grief; Mangled my poor flesh with whipping, Come kind death! and bring relief. Born on Afric's Golden Coast, Once I was as blest as you; Parents tender I could boast, Husband dear, and children too. ( 4 ) Whity Man he came from far, Sailing o'er the briny flood, Who, with help of British Tar, Buys up human flesh and blood. With the Baby at my breast (Other two were sleeping by) In my Hut I sat at rest, With no thought of danger nigh. From the Bush at even tide Rush'd the fierce man-stealing Crew; Seiz'd the Children by my side, Seiz'd the wretched Yamba too. ************ ************ ************ Then for love of filthy Gold, Strait they bore me to the sea; Cramm'd me down a Slave Ship's hold, Where were Hundreds stow'd like me. ( 5 ) Naked on the Platform lying, Now we cross the tumbling wave; Shrieking, sickening, fainting, dying, Deed of shame for Britons brave. At the savage Captain's beck, Now like Brutes they make us prance; Smack the Cat about the Deck, And in scorn they bid us dance. Nauseous horse beans they bring nigh, Sick and sad we cannot eat; Cat must cure the Sulks they cry, Down their throats we'll force the meat. ************ ************ ************ I in groaning passed the night, And did roll my aching head; At the break of morning light, My poor Child was cold and dead. ( 6 ) Happy, happy, there she lies, ""Thou shalt feel the lash no more, Thus full many a Negro dies 'Ere we reach the destin'd shore. Thee, sweet infant, none shall sell, Thou hast gained a wat'ry Grave Clean escap'd the Tyrants fell, While thy mother lives a Slave. Driven like Cattle to a fair, See they sell us young and old; Child from Mother too they tear, All for love of filthy Gold. ************ ************ ************ I was sold to Massa hard, Some have Massas kind and good; And again my back was scarr'd, Bad and stinted was my food. ( 7 ) Poor and wounded, faint and sick, All expos'd to burning sky, Massa bids me grass to pick, And I now am near to die. What and if to death he send me, Savage murder tho' it be, British Law shall ne'er befriend me, They protect not Slaves like me."" Mourning thus my wretched state, (Ne'er may I forget the day) Once in dusk of evening late, Far from home I dar'd to stray; Dar'd, alas! with impious haste Tow'rds the roaring Sea to fly; Death itself I long'd to taste, Long'd to cast me in and Die. There I met upon the Strand English Missionary Good, He had Bible book in hand, Which poor me no understood. Led by pity from afar He had left his native ground; Thus if some inflict a scar, Others fly to cure the wound. ( 8 ) Strait he pull'd me from the shore, Bid me no self-murder do; Talk'd of state when life is o'er, All from Bible good and true. Then he led me to his Cot, Sooth'd and pity'd all my woe; Told me 'twas the Christian's lot Much to suffer here below. Told me then of God's dear Son, (Strange and wond'rous is the story;) What sad wrong to him was done, Tho' he was the Lord of Glory. Told me too, like one who knew him, (Can such love as this be true?) How he died for them that slew him, Died for wretched Yamba too. Freely he his mercy proffer'd, And to Sinners he was sent; E'en to Massa pardon's offer'd; O if Massa would repent! Wicked deed full many a time Sinful Yamba too hath done But she wails to God her crime, But she trusts his only Son. ( 9 ) O ye slaves whom Massas beat, Ye are stained with guilt within; As ye hope for mercy sweet, So forgive your Massas' sin. And with grief when sinking low, Mark the Road that Yamba trod; Think how all her pain and woe Brought the Captive home to God. Now let Yamba too adore Gracious Heaven's mysterious Plan; Now I'll count thy mercies o'er, Flowing thro' the guilt of man. Now I'll bless my cruel capture, (Hence I've known a Saviour's name) Till my Grief is turn'd to Rapture, And I half forget the blame. But tho' here a Convert rare Thanks her God for Grace divine, Let not man the glory share, Sinner, still the guilt is thine. Here an injured Slave forgives, There a Host for vengeance cry; Here a single Yamba lives, There a thousand droop and die. ( 10 ) ************ ************ ************ Duly now baptiz'd am I By good Missionary Man; Lord my nature purify As no outward water can! All my former thoughts abhorr'd, Teach me now to pray and praise; Joy and Glory in my Lord, Trust and serve him all my days.
