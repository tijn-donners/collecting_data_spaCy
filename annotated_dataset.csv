IF heaven has into being deign'd to call Thy light, O LIBERTY! to shine on all; Bright intellectual Sun! why does thy ray To earth distribute only partial day? Since no resisting cause from spirit flows 5 Thy penetrating essence to opose; No obstacles by Nature's hand imprest, Thy subtle and ethereal beams arrest; Nor motion's laws can speed thy active course, Nor strong repulsion's pow'rs obstruct thy force; 10 Since there is no convexity in MIND, Why are thy genial beams to parts confin'd? 2 While the chill North with thy bright ray is blest, Why should fell darkness half the South invest? Was it decreed, fair Freedom! at thy birth, 15 That thou shou'd'st ne'er irradiate all the earth? While Britain basks in thy full blaze of light, Why lies sad Afric quench'd in total night? Thee only, sober Goddess! I attest, In smiles chastis'd, and decent graces drest. 20 Not that unlicens'd monster of the crowd, Whose roar terrific bursts in peals so loud, Deaf'ning the ear of Peace: fierce Faction's tool; Of rash Sedition born, and mad Misrule; Whose stubborn mouth, rejecting Reason's rein, 25 No strength can govern, and no skill restrain; Whose magic cries the frantic vulgar draw To spurn at Order, and to outrage Law; 3 To tread on grave Authority and Pow'r, And shake the work of ages in an hour: 30 Convuls'd her voice, and pestilent her breath, She raves of mercy, while she deals out death: Each blast is fate; she darts from either hand Red conflagration o'er th' astonish'd land; Clamouring for peace, she rends the air with noise, 35 And to reform a part, the whole destroys. O, plaintive Southerne! * whose impassion'd strain So oft has wak'd my languid Muse in vain! Now, when congenial themes her cares engage, She burns to emulate thy glowing page; 40 Her failing efforts mock her fond desires, She shares thy feelings, not partakes thy fires. Strange pow'r of song! the strain that warms the heart Seems the same inspiration to impart; * Author of the Tragedy of Oronoko 4 Touch'd by the kindling energy alone, 45 We think the flame which melts us is our own; Deceiv'd, for genius we mistake delight, Charm'd as we read, we fancy we can write. Tho' not to me, sweet Bard, thy pow'rs belong Fair Truth, a hallow'd guide! inspires my song. 50 Here Art wou'd weave her gayest flow'rs in vain, For Truth the bright invention wou'd disdain. For no fictitious ills these numbers flow, But living anguish, and substantial woe; No individual griefs my bosom melt, 55 For millions feel what Oronoko felt: Fir'd by no single wrongs, the countless host I mourn, by rapine dragg'd from Afric's coast. Perish th'illiberal thought which wou'd debase The native genius of the sable race! 60 5 Perish the proud philosophy, which sought To rob them of the pow'rs of equal thought! Does then th' immortal principle within Change with the casual colour of a skin? Does matter govern spirit? or is mind 65 Degraded by the form to which 'tis join'd? No: they have heads to think, and hearts to feel, And souls to act, with firm, tho' erring, zeal; For they have keen affections, kind desires, Love strong as death, and active patriot fires; 70 All the rude energy, the fervid flame, Of high-soul'd passion, and ingenuous shame: Strong, but luxuriant virtues boldly shoot From the wild vigour of a savage root. Nor weak their sense of honour's proud control, 75 For pride is virtue in a Pagan soul; 6 A sense of worth, a conscience of desert, A high, unbroken haughtiness of heart: That self-same stuff which erst proud empires sway'd, Of which the conquerers of the world were made. 80 Capricious fate of man! that very pride In Afric scourg'd, in Rome was deify'd. No Muse, O * Quashi! shall thy deeds relate, No statue snatch thee from oblivious fate! * It is a point of honour among negroes of a high spirit to die rather than to suffer their glossy skin to bear the mark of the whip. Qua-shi had somehow offended his master, a young planter with whom he had been bred up in the endearing intimacy of a play-fellow. His services had been faithful; his attachment affectionate. The master resolved to punish him, and persued him for that purpose. In trying to escape Qua-shi stumbled and fell; the master fell upon him; they wrestled long with doubtful victory; at length Qua-shi got uppermost, and, being firmly seated on his master's breast, he secured his legs with one hand, and with the other drew a sharp knife; then said, ""Master, I have been bred up with you from a child; I have loved you as myself: in 7 For thou wast born where never gentle Muse 85 On Valour's grave the flow'rs of Genius strews; And thou wast born where no recording page Plucks the fair deed from Time's devouring rage. Had Fortune plac'd thee on some happier coast, Where polish'd souls heroic virtue boast, 90 To thee, who sought'st a voluntary grave, Th' uninjur'd honours of thy name to save, Whose generous arm thy barbarous Master spar'd, Altars had smok'd, and temples had been rear'd. Whene'er to Afric's shores I turn my eyes, 95 Horrors of deepest, deadliest guilt arise; return, you have condemned me to a punishment of which I must ever have borne the marks: thus only can I avoid them;"" so saying, he drew the knife with all his strength across his own throat, and fell down dead, without a groan, on his master's body. Ramsay's Essay on the Treatment of African Slaves. 8 I see, by more than Fancy's mirror shewn, The burning village, and the blazing town: See the dire victim torn from social life, The shrieking babe, the agonizing wife! 100 She, wretch forlorn! is dragg'd by hostile hands, To distant tyrants sold, in distant lands! Transmitted miseries, and successive chains, The sole sad heritage her child obtains! Ev'n this last wretched boon their foes deny, 105 To weep together, or together die. By felon hands, by one relentless stroke, See the fond links of feeling nature broke! The fibres twisting round a parent's heart, Torn from their grasp, and bleeding as they part. 110 Hold, murderers, hold! not aggravate distress; Respect the passions you yourselves possess; 9 Ev'n you, of ruffian heart, and ruthless hand, Love your own offspring, love your native land. Ah! leave them holy Freedom's cheering smile, 115 The heav'n-taught fondness for the parent soil; Revere affections mingled with our frame, In every nature, every clime the same; In all, these feelings equal sway maintain; In all the love of HOME and FREEDOM reign: 120 And Tempe's vale, and parch'd Angola's sand, One equal fondness of their sons command. Th' unconquer'd Savage laughs at pain and toil, Basking in Freedom's beams which gild his native soil. Does thirst of empire, does desire of fame, 125 (For these are specious crimes) our rage inflame? No: sordid lust of gold their fate controls, The basest appetite of basest souls; 10 Gold, better gain'd, by what their ripening sky, Their fertile fields, their arts * and mines supply. 130 What wrongs, what injuries does Oppression plead To smooth the horror of th' unnatural deed? What strange offence, what aggravated sin? They stand convicted--of a darker skin! Barbarians, hold! th' opprobious commerce spare, 135 Respect his sacred image which they bear: Tho' dark and savage, ignorant and blind, They claim the common privilege of kind; Let Malice strip them of each other plea, They still are men, and men shou'd still be free. 140 Insulted Reason, loaths th' inverted trade-- Dire change! the agent is the purchase made! * Besides many valuable productions of the soil, cloths and carpets of exquisite manufacture are brought from the coast of Guinea. 11 Perplex'd, the baffled Muse involves the tale; Nature confounded, well may language fail! The outrag'd Goddess with abhorrent eyes 145 Sees MAN the traffic, SOULS the merchandize! Plead not, in reason's palpable abuse, Their sense of * feeling callous and obtuse: From heads to hearts lies Nature's plain appeal, Tho' few can reason, all mankind can feel. 150 Tho' wit may boast a livelier dread of shame, A loftier sense of wrong refinement claim; Tho' polished manners may fresh wants invent, And nice distinctions nicer souls torment; Tho' these on finer spirits heavier fall, 155 Yet natural evils are the same to all. * Nothing is more frequent than this cruel and stupid argument, that they do not feel the miseries inflicted on them as Europeans would do. 12 Tho' wounds there are which reason's force may heal, There needs no logic sure to make us feel. The nerve, howe'er untutor'd, can sustain A sharp, unutterable sense of pain; 160 As exquisitely fashion'd in a slave, As where unequal fate a sceptre gave. Sense is as keen where Congo's sons preside, As where proud Tiber rolls his classic tide. Rhetoric or verse may point the feeling line, 165 They do not whet sensation, but define. Did ever slave less feel the galling chain, When Zeno prov'd there was no ill in pain? Their miseries philosophic quirks deride, Slaves groan in pangs disown'd by Stoic pride. 170 When the fierce Sun darts vertical his beams, And thirst and hunger mix their wild extremes; 13 When the sharp iron * wounds his inmost soul, And his strain'd eyes in burning anguish roll; Will the parch'd negro find, ere he expire, 175 No pain in hunger, and no heat in fire? For him, when fate his tortur'd frame destroys, What hope of present fame, or future joys? For this, have heroes shorten'd nature's date; For that, have martyrs gladly met their fate; 180 But him, forlorn, no hero's pride sustains, No martyr's blissful visions sooth his pains; Sullen, he mingles with his kindred dust, For he has learn'd to dread the Christian's trust; * This is not said figuratively. The writer of these lines has seen a complete set of chains, fitted to every separate limb of these unhappy, innocent men; together with instruments for wrenching open the jaws, contrived with such ingenious cruelty as would shock the humanity of an inquisitor. 14 To him what mercy can that Pow'r display, 185 Whose servants murder, and whose sons betray? Savage! thy venial error I deplore, They are not Christians who infest thy shore. O thou sad spirit, whose preposterous yoke The great deliver Death, at length, has broke! 190 Releas'd from misery, and escap'd from care, Go meet that mercy man deny'd thee here. In thy dark home, sure refuge of th' opress'd, The wicked vex not, and the weary rest. And, if some notions, vague and undefin'd, 195 Of future terrors have assail'd thy mind; If such thy masters have presum'd to teach, As terrors only they are prone to preach; (For shou'd they paint eternal Mercy's reign, Where were th' oppressor's rod, the captive's chain?) 200 15 If, then, thy troubled soul has learn'd to dread The dark unknown thy trembling footsteps tread; On HIM, who made thee what thou art, depend; HE, who withholds the means, accepts the end. Not thine the reckoning dire of LIGHT abus'd, 205 KNOWLEDGE disgrac'd, and LIBERTY misus'd; On thee no awful judge incens'd shall sit For parts perverted, and dishonour'd wit. Where ignorance will be found the surest plea, How many learn'd and wise shall envy thee! 210 And thou, WHITE SAVAGE! whether lust of gold, Or lust of conquest, rule thee uncontrol'd! Hero, or robber!--by whatever name Thou plead thy impious claim to wealth or fame; Whether inferior mischiefs be thy boast, 215 A petty tyrant rifling Gambia's coast: 16 Or bolder carnage track thy crimson way, Kings disposses'd, and Provinces thy prey; Panting to tame wide earth's remotest bound; All Cortez murder'd, all Columbus found; 220 O'er plunder'd realms to reign, detested Lord, Make millions wretched, and thyself abhorr'd;---- In Reason's eye, in Wisdom's fair account, Your sum of glory boasts a like amount; The means may differ, but the end's the same; 225 Conquest is pillage with a nobler name. Who makes the sum of human blessings less, Or sinks the stock of general happiness, No solid fame shall grace, no true renown, His life shall blazon, or his memory crown. 230 Had those advent'rous spirits who explore Thro' ocean's trackless wastes, the far-sought shore; 17 Whether of wealth insatiate, or of pow'r, Conquerors who waste, or ruffians who devour: Had these possess'd, O COOK! thy gentle mind, 235 Thy love of arts, thy love of humankind; Had these pursued thy mild and liberal plan, DISCOVERERS had not been a curse to man! The, bless'd Philanthropy! thy social hands Had link'd dissever'd worlds in brothers bands; 240 Careless, if colour, or if clime divide; Then, lov'd, and loving, man had liv'd, and died. The purest wreaths which hang on glory's shrine, For empires founded, peaceful PENN! are thine; No blood-stain'd laurels crown'd thy virtuous toil, 245 No slaughter'd natives drench'd thy fair-earn'd soil. Still thy meek spirit in thy * flock survives, Consistent still, their doctrines rule their lives; * The Quakers have emancipated all their slaves throughout America. 18 Thy followers only have effac'd the shame Inscrib'd by SLAVERY on the Christian name. 250 Shall Britain, where the soul of freedom reigns, Forge chains for others she herself disdains? Forbid it, Heaven! O let the nations know The liberty she loves she will bestow; Not to herself the glorious gift confin'd, 255 She spreads the blessing wide as humankind; And, scorning narrow views of time and place, Bids all be free in earth's extended space. What page of human annals can record A deed so bright as human rights restor'd? 260 O may that god-like deed, that shining page, Redeem OUR fame, and consecrate OUR age! And see, the cherub Mercy from above, Descending softly, quits the sphere of love! 19 On feeling hearts she sheds celestial dew, 265 And breathes her spirit o'er th' enlighten'd few; From soul to soul the spreading influence steals, Till every breast the soft contagion feels. She bears, exulting, to the burning shore The loveliest office Angel ever bore; 270 To vindicate the pow'r in Heaven ador'd, To still the clank of chains, and sheathe the sword; To cheer the mourner, and with soothing hands From bursting hearts unbind th' Oppressor's bands; To raise the lustre of the Christian name, 275 And clear the foulest blot that dims its fame. As the mild Spirit hovers o'er the coast, A fresher hue the wither'd landscapes boast; Her healing smiles the ruin'd scenes repair, And blasted Nature wears a joyous air. 280 20 She spreads her blest commission from above, Stamp'd with the sacred characters of love; She tears the banner stain'd with blood and tears, And, LIBERTY! thy shining standard rears! As the bright ensign's glory she displays, 285 See pale OPPRESSION faints beneath the blaze! The giant dies! no more his frown appals, The chain untouch'd, drops off; the fetter falls. Astonish'd echo tells the vocal shore, Opression's fall'n, and Slavery is no more! 290 The dusky myriads crowd the sultry plain, And hail that mercy long invok'd in vain. Victorious Pow'r! she bursts their two-fold bands, And FAITH and FREEDOM spring from Mercy's hands.

As the mild Spirit hovers o'er the coast, A fresher hue the wither'd landscapes boast; Her healing smiles the ruin'd scenes repair, And blasted Nature wears a joyous air. 280 20 She spreads her blest commission from above, Stamp'd with the sacred characters of love; She tears the banner stain'd with blood and tears, And, LIBERTY! thy shining standard rears! As the bright ensign's glory she displays, 285 See pale OPPRESSION faints beneath the blaze! The giant dies! no more his frown appals, The chain untouch'd, drops off; the fetter falls. Astonish'd echo tells the vocal shore, Opression's fall'n, and Slavery is no more! 290 The dusky myriads crowd the sultry plain, And hail that mercy long invok'd in vain. Victorious Pow'r! she bursts their two-fold bands, And FAITH and FREEDOM spring from Mercy's hands.

Go seek the soul refin'd and strong: Such aids my wildest pow'r of song: For those I strike the rustic lyre Who share the transports they inspire. LONDON PRINTED FOR G.G.J. AND J. ROBINSON, PATERNOSTER-ROW To the Right Hon. and Right Rev. FREDERICK, Earl of Bristol, Bishop of Derry, &c. &c. MY LORD, BEING convinced that your Ideas of Justice and Humanity are not confined to one Race of Men, I have endeavoured to lead you to the Indian Coast. My Intention is not to cause that Anguish in your Bosom which powerless Compassion ever gives: yet, my Vanity is flattered, when I but fancy that Your Lordship feels as I do. With the highest Reverence, I am, My Lord Your Lordship's much obliged, And obedient Servant, ANN YEARSLEY. A POEM ON THE INHUMANITY OF THE SLAVE-TRADE. BRISTOL, thine heart hath throbb'd to glory.—Slaves, E'en Christian slaves, have shook their chains, and gaz'd With wonder and amazement on thee. Hence Ye grov'ling souls, who think the term I give, Of Christian slave, a paradox! to you I do not turn, but leave you to conception [ 2 ] Narrow; with that be blest, nor dare to stretch Your shackled souls along the course of Freedom. Yet, Bristol, list! nor deem Lactilla's soul Lessen'd by distance; snatch her rustic thought, Her crude ideas, from their panting state, And let them fly in wide expansion; lend Thine energy, so little understood By the rude million, and I'll dare the strain Of Heav'n-born Liberty till Nature moves Obedient to her voice. Alas! my friend, Strong rapture dies within the soul, while Pow'r Drags on his bleeding victims. Custom, Law, Ye blessings, and ye curses of mankind, What evils do ye cause? We feel enslaved, Yet move in your direction. Custom, thou [ 3 ] Wilt preach up filial piety; thy sons Will groan, and stare with impudence at Heav'n, As if they did abjure the act, where Sin Sits full on Inhumanity; the church They fill with mouthing, vap'rous sighs and tears, Which, like the guileful crocodile's, oft fall, Nor fall, but at the cost of human bliss. Custom, thou hast undone us! led us far From God-like probity, from truth, and heaven. But come, ye souls who feel for human woe, Tho' drest in savage guise! Approach, thou son, Whose heart would shudder at a father's chains, And melt o'er thy lov'd brother as he lies Gasping in torment undeserv'd. Oh, sight [ 4 ] Horrid and insupportable! far worse Than an immediate, an heroic death; Yet to this sight I summon thee. Approach, Thou slave of avarice, that canst see the maid Weep o'er her inky sire! Spare me, thou God Of all-indulgent Mercy, if I scorn This gloomy wretch, and turn my tearful eye To more enlighten'd beings. Yes, my tear Shall hang on the green furze, like pearly dew Upon the blossom of the morn. My song Shall teach sad Philomel a louder note, When Nature swells her woe. O'er suff'ring man My soul with sorrow bends! Then come, ye few Who feel a more than cold, material essence; Here ye may vent your sighs, till the bleak North Find its adherents aided. —Ah, no more! [ 5 ] The dingy youth comes on, sullen in chains; He smiles on the rough sailor, who aloud Strikes at the spacious heav'n, the earth, the sea, In breath too blasphemous; yet not to him Blasphemous, for he dreads not either:—lost In dear internal imag'ry, the soul Of Indian Luco rises to his eyes, Silent, not inexpressive: the strong beams With eager wildness yet drink in the view Of his too humble home, where he had left His mourning father, and his Incilanda. Curse on the toils spread by a Christian hand To rob the Indian of his freedom! Curse On him who from a bending parent steals His dear support of age, his darling child; [ 6 ] Perhaps a son, or a more tender daughter, Who might have clos'd his eyelids, as the spark Of life gently retired. Oh, thou poor world! Thou fleeting good to individuals! see How much for thee they care, how wide they ope Their helpless arms to clasp thee; vapour thou! More swift than passing wind! thou leav'st them nought Amid th'unreal scene, but a scant grave. I know the crafty merchant will oppose The plea of nature to my strain, and urge His toils are for his children: the soft plea Dissolves my soul—but when I sell a son, Thou God of nature, let it be my own! Behold that Christian! see what horrid joy [ 7 ] Lights up his moody features, while he grasps The wish'd-for gold, purchase of human blood! Away, thou seller of mankind! Bring on Thy daughter to this market! bring thy wife! Thine aged mother, though of little worth, With all thy ruddy boys! Sell them, thou wretch, And swell the price of Luco! Why that start? Why gaze as thou wouldst fright me from my challenge With look of anguish? Is it Nature strains Thine heart-strings at the image? Yes, my charge Is full against her, and she rends thy soul, While I but strike upon thy pityless ear, Fearing her rights are violated. —Speak, Astound the voice of Justice! bid thy tears Melt the unpitying pow'r, while thus she claims The pledges of thy love. Oh, throw thine arm [ 8 ] Around thy little ones, and loudly plead Thou canst not sell thy children.—Yet, beware Lest Luco's groan be heard; should that prevail, Justice will scorn thee in her turn, and hold Thine act against thy pray'r. Why clasp, she cries, That blooming youth? Is it because thou lov'st him? Why Luco was belov'd: then wilt thou feel, Thou selfish Christian, for thy private woe, Yet cause such pangs to him that is a father? Whence comes thy right to barter for thy fellows? Where are thy statutes? Whose the iron pen That gave thee precedent? Give me the seal Of virtue, or religion, for thy trade, And I will ne'er upbraid thee; but if force Superior, hard brutality alone [ 9 ] Become thy boast, hence to some savage haunt, Nor claim protection from my social laws. Luco is gone; his little brothers weep, While his fond mother climbs the hoary rock Whose point o'er-hangs the main. No Luco there, No sound, save the hoarse billows. On she roves, With love, fear, hope, holding alternate rage In her too anxious bosom. Dreary main! Thy murmurs now are riot, while she stands List'ning to ev'ry breeze, waiting the step Of gentle Luco. Ah, return! return! Too hapless mother, thy indulgent arms Shall never clasp thy fetter'd Luco more. See Incilanda! artless maid, my soul Keeps pace with thee, and mourns. Now o'er the hill [ 10 ] She creeps, with timid foot, while Sol embrowns The bosom of the isle, to where she left Her faithful lover: here the well-known cave, By Nature form'd amid the rock, endears The image of her Luco; here his pipe, Form'd of the polish'd cane, neglected lies, No more to vibrate; here the useless dart, The twanging bow, and the fierce panther's skin, Salute the virgin's eye. But where is Luco? He comes not down the steep, tho' he had vow'd, When the sun's beams at noon should sidelong gild The cave's wide entrance, he would swift descend To bless his Incilanda. Ten pale moons Had glided by, since to his generous breast He clasp'd the tender maid, and whisper'd love. [ 11 ] Oh, mutual sentiment! thou dang'rous bliss! So exquisite, that Heav'n had been unjust Had it bestowd less exquisite of ill; When thou art held no more, thy pangs are deep, Thy joys convulsive to the soul; yet all Are meant to smooth th'uneven road of life. For Incilanda, Luco rang'd the wild, Holding her image to his panting heart; For her he strain'd the bow, for her he stript The bird of beauteous plumage; happy hour, When with these guiltless trophies he adorn'd The brow of her he lov'd. Her gentle breast With gratitude was fill'd, nor knew she aught Of language strong enough to paint her soul, Or ease the great emotion; whilst her eye [ 12 ] Pursued the gen'rous Luco to the field, And glow'd with rapture at his wish'd return. Ah, sweet suspense! betwixt the mingled cares Of friendship, love, and gratitude, so mix'd, That ev'n the soul may cheat herself.—Down, down, Intruding Memory! bid thy struggles cease, At this soft scene of innate war. What sounds Break on her ear? She, starting, whispers ""Luco."" Be still, fond maid; list to the tardy step Of leaden-footed woe. A father comes, But not to seek his son, who from the deck Had breath'd a last adieu: no, he shuts out The soft, fallacious gleam of hope, and turns Within upon the mind: horrid and dark Are his wild, unenlighten'd pow'rs: no ray [ 13 ] Of forc'd philosophy to calm his soul, But all the anarchy of wounded nature. Now he arraigns his country's gods, who sit, In his bright fancy, far beyond the hills, Unriveting the chains of slaves: his heart Beats quick with stubborn fury, while he doubts Their justice to his child. Weeping old man, Hate not a Christian's God, whose record holds Thine injured Luco's name. Frighted he starts, Blasphemes the Deity, whose altars rise Upon the Indian's helpless neck, and sinks, Despising comfort, till by grief and age His angry spirit is forced out. Oh, guide, Ye angel-forms, this joyless shade to worlds Where the poor Indian, with the sage, is prov'd [ 14 ] The work of a Creator. Pause not here, Distracted maid! ah, leave the breathless form, On whose cold cheek thy tears so swiftly fall, Too unavailing! On this stone, she cries, My Luco sat, and to the wand'ring stars Pointed my eye, while from his gentle tongue Fell old traditions of his country's woe. Where now shall Incilanda seek him? Hence, Defenceless mourner, ere the dreary night Wrap thee in added horror. Oh, Despair, How eagerly thou rend'st the heart! She pines In anguish deep, and sullen: Luco's form Pursues her, lives in restless thought, and chides Soft consolation. Banish'd from his arms, She seeks the cold embrace of death; her soul Escapes in one sad sigh. Too hapless maid! [ 15 ] Yet happier far than he thou lov'dst; his tear, His sigh, his groan avail not, for they plead Most weakly with a Christian. Sink, thou wretch, Whose act shall on the cheek of Albion's sons Throw Shame's red blush: thou, who hast frighted far Those simple wretches from thy God, and taught Their erring minds to mourn his * partial love, Profusely pour'd on thee, while they are left Neglected to thy mercy. Thus deceiv'd, How doubly dark must be their road to death! Luco is borne around the neighb'ring isles, Losing the knowledge of his native shore * Indians have been often heard to say, in their complaining moments, ""God Almighty no love us well; he be good to † buckera; he bid buckera burn us; he no burn buckera."" † White man [ 16 ] Amid the pathless wave; destin'd to plant The sweet luxuriant cane. He strives to please, Nor once complains, but greatly smothers grief. His hands are blister'd, and his feet are worn, Till ev'ry stroke dealt by his mattock gives Keen agony to life; while from his breast The sigh arises, burthen'd with the name Of Incilanda. Time inures the youth, His limbs grow nervous, strain'd by willing toil; And resignation, or a calm despair, (Most useful either) lulls him to repose. A Christian renegade, that from his soul Abjures the tenets of our schools, nor dreads A future punishment, nor hopes for mercy, Had fled from England, to avoid those laws [ 17 ] Which must have made his life a retribution To violated justice, and had gain'd, By fawning guile, the confidence (ill placed) Of Luco's master. O'er the slave he stands With knotted whip, lest fainting nature shun The task too arduous, while his cruel soul, Unnat'ral, ever feeds, with gross delight, Upon his suff rings. Many slaves there were, But none who could supress the sigh, and bend, So quietly as Luco: long he bore The stripes, that from his manly bosom drew The sanguine stream (too little priz'd); at length Hope fled his soul, giving her struggles o'er, And he resolv'd to die. The sun had reach'd His zenith—pausing faintly, Luco stood, Leaning upon his hoe, while mem'ry brought, [ 18 ] In piteous imag'ry, his aged father, His poor fond mother, and his faithful maid: The mental group in wildest motion set Fruitless imagination; fury, grief, Alternate shame, the sense of insult, all Conspire to aid the inward storm; yet words Were no relief, he stood in silent woe. Gorgon, remorseless Christian, saw the slave Stand musing, 'mid the ranks, and, stealing soft Behind the studious Luco, struck his cheek With a too-heavy whip, that reach'd his eye, Making it dark for ever. Luco turn'd, In strongest agony, and with his hoe Struck the rude Christian on the forehead. Pride, With hateful malice, seize on Gorgon's soul, [ 19 ] By nature fierce; while Luco sought the beach, And plung'd beneath the wave; but near him lay A planter's barge, whose seamen grasp'd his hair Dragging to life a wretch who wish'd to die. Rumour now spreads the tale, while Gorgon's breath Envenom'd, aids her blast: imputed crimes Oppose the plea of Luco, till he scorns Even a just defence, and stands prepared. The planters, conscious that to fear alone They owe their cruel pow'r, resolve to blend New torment with the pangs of death, and hold Their victims high in dreadful view, to fright The wretched number left. Luco is chain'd To a huge tree, his fellow-slaves are ranged To share the horrid sight; fuel is plac'd [ 20 ] In an increasing train, some paces back, To kindle slowly, and approach the youth, With more than native terror. See, it burns! He gazes on the growing flame, and calls For ""water, water!"" The small boon's deny'd. E'en Christians throng each other, to behold The different alterations of his face, As the hot death approaches. (Oh, shame, shame Upon the followers of Jesus! shame On him that dares avow a God!) He writhes, While down his breast glide the unpity'd tears, And in their sockets strain their scorched balls. ""Burn, burn me quick! I cannot die!"" he cries: ""Bring fire more close!"" The planters heed him not, But still prolonging Luco's torture, threat Their trembling slaves around. His lips are dry, [ 21 ] His senses seem to quiver, e'er they quit His frame for ever, rallying strong, then driv'n From the tremendous conflict. Sight no more Is Luco's, his parch'd tongue is ever mute; Yet in his soul his Incilanda stays, Till both escape together. Turn, my muse, From this sad scene; lead Bristol's milder soul To where the solitary spirit roves, Wrapt in the robe of innocence, to shades Where pity breathing in the gale, dissolves The mind, when fancy paints such real woe. Now speak, ye Christians (who for gain enslave A soul like Luco's, tearing her from joy In life's short vale; and if there be a hell, As ye believe, to that ye thrust her down, [ 22 ] A blind, involuntary victim), where Is your true essence of religion? where Your proofs of righteousness, when ye conceal The knowledge of the Deity from those Who would adore him fervently? Your God Ye rob of worshippers, his altars keep Unhail'd, while driving from the sacred font The eager slave, lest he should hope in Jesus. Is this your piety? Are these your laws, Whereby the glory of the Godhead spreads O'er barb'rous climes? Ye hypocrites, disown The Christian name, nor shame its cause: yet where Shall souls like yours find welcome? Would the Turk, Pagan, or wildest Arab, ope their arms To gain such proselytes? No; he that owns [ 23 ] The name of * Mussulman would start, and shun Your worse than serpent touch; he frees his slave Who turns to Mahomet. The † Spaniard stands Your brighter contrast; he condemns the youth For ever to the mine; but ere the wretch Sinks to the deep domain, the hand of Faith Bathes his faint temples in the sacred stream, Bidding his spirit hope. Briton, dost thou Act up to this? If so, bring on thy slaves To Calv'ry's mount, raise high their kindred souls To him who died to save them: this alone Will teach them calmly to obey thy rage, And deem a life of misery but a day, * The Turk gives freedom to his slave on condition that he embraces Mahometism. † The Spaniard, immediately on purchasing an Indian, gives him baptism. [ 24 ] To long eternity. Ah, think how soon Thine head shall on earth's dreary pillow lie, With thy poor slaves, each silent, and unknown To his once furious neighbour. Think how swift The sands of time ebb out, for him and thee. Why groans that Indian youth, in burning chains Suspended o'er the beach? The lab'ring sun Strikes from his full meridian on the slave Whose arms are blister'd by the heated iron, Which still corroding, seeks the bone. What crime Merits so dire a death? * Another gasps * A coromantin slave in Jamaica (who had frequently escaped to the mountains) was, a few years since, doomed to have his leg cut off. A young practitioner from England (after the surgeon of the estate had refused to be an executioner) undertook the operation, but after the removal of the limb, on the slave's exclaiming, You buckera! God Almightly made dat leg; you cut [ 25 ] With strongest agony, while life declines From recent amputation. Gracious God! Why thus in mercy let thy whirlwinds sleep O'er a vile race of Christians, who profane Thy glorious attributes? Sweep them from earth, Or check their cruel pow'r: the savage tribes Are angels when compared to brutes like these. Advance, ye Christians, and oppose my strain: Who dares condemn it? Prove from laws divine, From deep philosophy, or social love, it off! You put it on again? was so shocked, that the other surgeon was obliged to take up the vessals, apply the dressings, &c. The Negro suffered without a groan, called for his pipe, and calmly smoaked, till the absence of his attendant gave him an opportunity of tearing off his bandages, when he bled to death in an instant. Many will call this act of the Negro's stubbornness; under such circumstances, I dare give it a more glorious epithet, and that is fortitude. [ 26 ] That ye derive your privilege. I scorn The cry of Av'rice, or the trade that drains A fellow-creature's blood: bid Commerce plead Her publick good, her nation's many wants, Her sons thrown idly on the beach, forbade To seize the image of their God and sell it:— I'll hear her voice, and Virtue's hundred tongues Shall sound against her. Hath our public good Fell rapine for its basis? Must our wants Find their supply in murder? Shall the sons Of Commerce shiv'ring stand, if not employ'd Worse than the midnight robber? Curses fall On the destructive system that shall need Such base supports! Doth England need them? No; Her laws, with prudence, hang the meagre thief That from his neighbour steals a slender sum, [ 27 ] Tho' famine drove him on. O'er him the priest, Beneath the fatal tree, laments the crime, Approves the law, and bids him calmly die. Say, doth this law, that dooms the thief, protect The wretch who makes another's life his prey, By hellish force to take it at his will? Is this an English law, whose guidance fails When crimes are swell'd to magnitude so vast, That Justice dare not scan them? Or does Law Bid Justice an eternal distance keep From England's great tribunal, when the slave Calls loud on Justice only? Speak, ye few Who fill Britannia's senate, and are deem'd The fathers of your country! Boast your laws, Defend the honour of a land so fall'n, [ 28 ] That Fame from ev'ry battlement is flown, And Heathens start, e'en at a Christian's name. Hail, social love! true soul of order, hail! Thy softest emanations, pity, grief, Lively emotion, sudden joy, and pangs, Too. deep for language, are thy own: then rise, Thou gentle angel! spread thy silken wings O'er drowsy man, breathe in his soul, and give Her God-like pow'rs thy animating force, To banish Inhumanity. Oh, loose The fetters of his mind, enlarge his views, Break down for him the bound of avarice, lift His feeble faculties beyond a world To which he soon must prove a stranger! Spread Before his ravish'd eye the varied tints [ 29 ] Of future glory; bid them live to Fame, Whose banners wave for ever. Thus inspired, All that is great, and good, and sweetly mild, Shall fill his noble bosom. He shall melt, Yea, by thy sympathy unseen, shall feel Another's pang: for the lamenting maid His heart shall heave a sigh; with the old slave (Whose head is bent with sorrow) he shall cast His eye back on the joys of youth, and say, ""Thou once couldst feel, as I do, love's pure bliss; ""Parental fondness, and the dear returns ""Of filial tenderness were thine, till torn ""From the dissolving scene.""—Oh, social love, Thou universal good, thou that canst fill The vacuum of immensity, and live In endless void! thou that in motion first [ 30 ] Set'st the long lazy atoms, by thy force Quickly assimilating, and restrain'd By strong attraction; touch the soul of man; Subdue him; make a fellow-creature's woe His own by heart-felt sympathy, whilst wealth Is made subservient to his soft disease. And when thou hast to high perfection wrought This mighty work, say, ""such is Bristol's soul.""

So exquisite, that Heav'n had been unjust Had it bestowd less exquisite of ill; When thou art held no more, thy pangs are deep, Thy joys convulsive to the soul; yet all Are meant to smooth th'uneven road of life. For Incilanda, Luco rang'd the wild, Holding her image to his panting heart; For her he strain'd the bow, for her he stript The bird of beauteous plumage; happy hour, When with these guiltless trophies he adorn'd The brow of her he lov'd. Her gentle breast With gratitude was fill'd, nor knew she aught Of language strong enough to paint her soul, Or ease the great emotion; whilst her eye [ 12 ] Pursued the gen'rous Luco to the field, And glow'd with rapture at his wish'd return. Ah, sweet suspense! betwixt the mingled cares Of friendship, love, and gratitude, so mix'd, That ev'n the soul may cheat herself.—Down, down, Intruding Memory! bid thy struggles cease, At this soft scene of innate war. What sounds Break on her ear? She, starting, whispers ""Luco."" Be still, fond maid; list to the tardy step Of leaden-footed woe. A father comes, But not to seek his son, who from the deck Had breath'd a last adieu: no, he shuts out The soft, fallacious gleam of hope, and turns Within upon the mind: horrid and dark Are his wild, unenlighten'd pow'rs: no ray [ 13 ] Of forc'd philosophy to calm his soul, But all the anarchy of wounded nature. Now he arraigns his country's gods, who sit, In his bright fancy, far beyond the hills, Unriveting the chains of slaves: his heart Beats quick with stubborn fury, while he doubts Their justice to his child. Weeping old man, Hate not a Christian's God, whose record holds Thine injured Luco's name. Frighted he starts, Blasphemes the Deity, whose altars rise Upon the Indian's helpless neck, and sinks, Despising comfort, till by grief and age His angry spirit is forced out. Oh, guide, Ye angel-forms, this joyless shade to worlds Where the poor Indian, with the sage, is prov'd [ 14 ] The work of a Creator. Pause not here, Distracted maid! ah, leave the breathless form, On whose cold cheek thy tears so swiftly fall, Too unavailing! On this stone, she cries, My Luco sat, and to the wand'ring stars Pointed my eye, while from his gentle tongue Fell old traditions of his country's woe. Where now shall Incilanda seek him? Hence, Defenceless mourner, ere the dreary night Wrap thee in added horror. Oh, Despair, How eagerly thou rend'st the heart! She pines In anguish deep, and sullen: Luco's form Pursues her, lives in restless thought, and chides Soft consolation. Banish'd from his arms, She seeks the cold embrace of death; her soul Escapes in one sad sigh. Too hapless maid! [ 15 ] Yet happier far than he thou lov'dst; his tear, His sigh, his groan avail not, for they plead Most weakly with a Christian. Sink, thou wretch, Whose act shall on the cheek of Albion's sons Throw Shame's red blush: thou, who hast frighted far Those simple wretches from thy God, and taught Their erring minds to mourn his * partial love, Profusely pour'd on thee, while they are left Neglected to thy mercy. Thus deceiv'd, How doubly dark must be their road to death! Luco is borne around the neighb'ring isles, Losing the knowledge of his native shore * Indians have been often heard to say, in their complaining moments, ""God Almighty no love us well; he be good to † buckera; he bid buckera burn us; he no burn buckera."" † White man [ 16 ] Amid the pathless wave; destin'd to plant The sweet luxuriant cane. He strives to please, Nor once complains, but greatly smothers grief. His hands are blister'd, and his feet are worn, Till ev'ry stroke dealt by his mattock gives Keen agony to life; while from his breast The sigh arises, burthen'd with the name Of Incilanda. Time inures the youth, His limbs grow nervous, strain'd by willing toil; And resignation, or a calm despair, (Most useful either) lulls him to repose. A Christian renegade, that from his soul Abjures the tenets of our schools, nor dreads A future punishment, nor hopes for mercy, Had fled from England, to avoid those laws [ 17 ] Which must have made his life a retribution To violated justice, and had gain'd, By fawning guile, the confidence (ill placed) Of Luco's master. O'er the slave he stands With knotted whip, lest fainting nature shun The task too arduous, while his cruel soul, Unnat'ral, ever feeds, with gross delight, Upon his suff rings. Many slaves there were, But none who could supress the sigh, and bend, So quietly as Luco: long he bore The stripes, that from his manly bosom drew The sanguine stream (too little priz'd); at length Hope fled his soul, giving her struggles o'er, And he resolv'd to die. The sun had reach'd His zenith—pausing faintly, Luco stood, Leaning upon his hoe, while mem'ry brought, [ 18 ] In piteous imag'ry, his aged father, His poor fond mother, and his faithful maid: The mental group in wildest motion set Fruitless imagination; fury, grief, Alternate shame, the sense of insult, all Conspire to aid the inward storm; yet words Were no relief, he stood in silent woe. Gorgon, remorseless Christian, saw the slave Stand musing, 'mid the ranks, and, stealing soft Behind the studious Luco, struck his cheek With a too-heavy whip, that reach'd his eye, Making it dark for ever. Luco turn'd, In strongest agony, and with his hoe Struck the rude Christian on the forehead. Pride, With hateful malice, seize on Gorgon's soul, [ 19 ] By nature fierce; while Luco sought the beach, And plung'd beneath the wave; but near him lay A planter's barge, whose seamen grasp'd his hair Dragging to life a wretch who wish'd to die. Rumour now spreads the tale, while Gorgon's breath Envenom'd, aids her blast: imputed crimes Oppose the plea of Luco, till he scorns Even a just defence, and stands prepared. The planters, conscious that to fear alone They owe their cruel pow'r, resolve to blend New torment with the pangs of death, and hold Their victims high in dreadful view, to fright The wretched number left. Luco is chain'd To a huge tree, his fellow-slaves are ranged To share the horrid sight; fuel is plac'd [ 20 ] In an increasing train, some paces back, To kindle slowly, and approach the youth, With more than native terror. See, it burns! He gazes on the growing flame, and calls For ""water, water!"" The small boon's deny'd. E'en Christians throng each other, to behold The different alterations of his face, As the hot death approaches. (Oh, shame, shame Upon the followers of Jesus! shame On him that dares avow a God!) He writhes, While down his breast glide the unpity'd tears, And in their sockets strain their scorched balls. ""Burn, burn me quick! I cannot die!"" he cries: ""Bring fire more close!"" The planters heed him not, But still prolonging Luco's torture, threat Their trembling slaves around. His lips are dry, [ 21 ] His senses seem to quiver, e'er they quit His frame for ever, rallying strong, then driv'n From the tremendous conflict. Sight no more Is Luco's, his parch'd tongue is ever mute; Yet in his soul his Incilanda stays, Till both escape together. Turn, my muse, From this sad scene; lead Bristol's milder soul To where the solitary spirit roves, Wrapt in the robe of innocence, to shades Where pity breathing in the gale, dissolves The mind, when fancy paints such real woe. Now speak, ye Christians (who for gain enslave A soul like Luco's, tearing her from joy In life's short vale; and if there be a hell, As ye believe, to that ye thrust her down, [ 22 ] A blind, involuntary victim), where Is your true essence of religion? where Your proofs of righteousness, when ye conceal The knowledge of the Deity from those Who would adore him fervently? Your God Ye rob of worshippers, his altars keep Unhail'd, while driving from the sacred font The eager slave, lest he should hope in Jesus. Is this your piety? Are these your laws, Whereby the glory of the Godhead spreads O'er barb'rous climes? Ye hypocrites, disown The Christian name, nor shame its cause: yet where Shall souls like yours find welcome? Would the Turk, Pagan, or wildest Arab, ope their arms To gain such proselytes? No; he that owns [ 23 ] The name of * Mussulman would start, and shun Your worse than serpent touch; he frees his slave Who turns to Mahomet. The † Spaniard stands Your brighter contrast; he condemns the youth For ever to the mine; but ere the wretch Sinks to the deep domain, the hand of Faith Bathes his faint temples in the sacred stream, Bidding his spirit hope. Briton, dost thou Act up to this? If so, bring on thy slaves To Calv'ry's mount, raise high their kindred souls To him who died to save them: this alone Will teach them calmly to obey thy rage, And deem a life of misery but a day, * The Turk gives freedom to his slave on condition that he embraces Mahometism. † The Spaniard, immediately on purchasing an Indian, gives him baptism. [ 24 ] To long eternity. Ah, think how soon Thine head shall on earth's dreary pillow lie, With thy poor slaves, each silent, and unknown To his once furious neighbour. Think how swift The sands of time ebb out, for him and thee. Why groans that Indian youth, in burning chains Suspended o'er the beach? The lab'ring sun Strikes from his full meridian on the slave Whose arms are blister'd by the heated iron, Which still corroding, seeks the bone. What crime Merits so dire a death? * Another gasps * A coromantin slave in Jamaica (who had frequently escaped to the mountains) was, a few years since, doomed to have his leg cut off. A young practitioner from England (after the surgeon of the estate had refused to be an executioner) undertook the operation, but after the removal of the limb, on the slave's exclaiming, You buckera! God Almightly made dat leg; you cut [ 25 ] With strongest agony, while life declines From recent amputation. Gracious God! Why thus in mercy let thy whirlwinds sleep O'er a vile race of Christians, who profane Thy glorious attributes? Sweep them from earth, Or check their cruel pow'r: the savage tribes Are angels when compared to brutes like these. Advance, ye Christians, and oppose my strain: Who dares condemn it? Prove from laws divine, From deep philosophy, or social love, it off! You put it on again? was so shocked, that the other surgeon was obliged to take up the vessals, apply the dressings, &c. The Negro suffered without a groan, called for his pipe, and calmly smoaked, till the absence of his attendant gave him an opportunity of tearing off his bandages, when he bled to death in an instant. Many will call this act of the Negro's stubbornness; under such circumstances, I dare give it a more glorious epithet, and that is fortitude. [ 26 ] That ye derive your privilege. I scorn The cry of Av'rice, or the trade that drains A fellow-creature's blood: bid Commerce plead Her publick good, her nation's many wants, Her sons thrown idly on the beach, forbade To seize the image of their God and sell it:— I'll hear her voice, and Virtue's hundred tongues Shall sound against her. Hath our public good Fell rapine for its basis? Must our wants Find their supply in murder? Shall the sons Of Commerce shiv'ring stand, if not employ'd Worse than the midnight robber? Curses fall On the destructive system that shall need Such base supports! Doth England need them? No; Her laws, with prudence, hang the meagre thief That from his neighbour steals a slender sum, [ 27 ] Tho' famine drove him on. O'er him the priest, Beneath the fatal tree, laments the crime, Approves the law, and bids him calmly die. Say, doth this law, that dooms the thief, protect The wretch who makes another's life his prey, By hellish force to take it at his will? Is this an English law, whose guidance fails When crimes are swell'd to magnitude so vast, That Justice dare not scan them? Or does Law Bid Justice an eternal distance keep From England's great tribunal, when the slave Calls loud on Justice only? Speak, ye few Who fill Britannia's senate, and are deem'd The fathers of your country! Boast your laws, Defend the honour of a land so fall'n, [ 28 ] That Fame from ev'ry battlement is flown, And Heathens start, e'en at a Christian's name. Hail, social love! true soul of order, hail! Thy softest emanations, pity, grief, Lively emotion, sudden joy, and pangs, Too. deep for language, are thy own: then rise, Thou gentle angel! spread thy silken wings O'er drowsy man, breathe in his soul, and give Her God-like pow'rs thy animating force, To banish Inhumanity. Oh, loose The fetters of his mind, enlarge his views, Break down for him the bound of avarice, lift His feeble faculties beyond a world To which he soon must prove a stranger! Spread Before his ravish'd eye the varied tints [ 29 ] Of future glory; bid them live to Fame, Whose banners wave for ever. Thus inspired, All that is great, and good, and sweetly mild, Shall fill his noble bosom. He shall melt, Yea, by thy sympathy unseen, shall feel Another's pang: for the lamenting maid His heart shall heave a sigh; with the old slave (Whose head is bent with sorrow) he shall cast His eye back on the joys of youth, and say, ""Thou once couldst feel, as I do, love's pure bliss; ""Parental fondness, and the dear returns ""Of filial tenderness were thine, till torn ""From the dissolving scene.""—Oh, social love, Thou universal good, thou that canst fill The vacuum of immensity, and live In endless void! thou that in motion first [ 30 ] Set'st the long lazy atoms, by thy force Quickly assimilating, and restrain'd By strong attraction; touch the soul of man; Subdue him; make a fellow-creature's woe His own by heart-felt sympathy, whilst wealth Is made subservient to his soft disease. And when thou hast to high perfection wrought This mighty work, say, ""such is Bristol's soul.""

2,Barbauld_1791.txt,"EPISTLE TO WILLIAM WILBERFORCE, ESQ. [Price One Shilling.] EPISTLE TO WILLIAM WILBERFORCE, ESQ. ON THE REJECTION OF THE BILL FOR ABOLISHING THE SLAVE TRADE. BY ANNA LETITIA BARBAULD. LONDON: PRINTED FOR J. JOHNSON, NO 72, ST. PAULS CHURCH-YARD. M.DCC.XCI. EPISTLE TO WILLIAM WILBERFORCE, ESQ. CEASE, Wilberforce, to urge thy generous aim! Thy Country knows the sin, and stands the shame! The Preacher, Poet, Senator in vain Has rattled in her sight the Negro's chain; [ 6 ] With his deep groans assail'd her startled ear, And rent the veil that hid his constant tear; Forc'd her averted eyes his stripes to scan, Beneath the bloody scourge laid bare the man, Claimed Pity's tear, urged Conscience' strong controul, And flash'd conviction on her shrinking soul. The Muse, too soon awaked, with ready tongue At Mercy's shrine applausive peans rung; And Freedom's eager sons, in vain foretold A new Astrean reign, an age of gold: She knows and she persists—Still Afric bleeds, Uncheck'd, the human traffic still proceeds; She stamps her infamy to future time, And on her harden'd forehead seals the crime. [ 7 ] In vain, to thy white standard gathering round, Wit, Worth, and Parts and Eloquence are found: In vain, to push to birth thy great design, Contending chiefs, and hostile virtues join; All, from conflicting ranks, of power possest To rouse, to melt, or to inform the breast. Where seasoned tools of Avarice prevail, A Nation's eloquence, combined, must fail: Each flimsy sophistry by turns they try; The plausive argument, the daring lye, The artful gloss, that moral sense confounds, Th' acknowledged thirst of gain that honour wounds: Bane of ingenuous minds, th' unfeeling sneer, Which, sudden, turns to stone the falling tear: [ 8 ] They search assiduous, with inverted skill, For forms of wrong, and precedents of ill; With impious mockery wrest the sacred page, And glean up crimes from each remoter age: Wrung Nature's tortures, shuddering, while you tell, From scoffing fiends bursts forth the laugh of hell; In Britain's senate, Misery's pangs give birth To jests unseemly, and to horrid mirth— Forbear!—thy virtues but provoke our doom, And swell th' account of vengeance yet to come; For, not unmarked in Heaven's impartial plan, Shall man, proud worm, contemn his fellow-man? And injur'd Afric, by herself redrest, Darts her own serpents at her Tyrant's breast.

Whose efforts yet arrest Heav'n's lifted hand, Around whose steady brows, in union bright, The civic wreath, and Christian's palm unite: [ 14 ] Your merit stands, no greater and no less, Without, or with the varnish of success; But seek no more to break a Nation's fall, For ye have sav'd yourselves—and that is all. Succeeding times your struggles, and their fate, With mingled shame and triumph shall relate, While faithful History, in her various page, Marking the features of this motley age, To shed a glory, and to fix a stain, Tells how you strove, and that you strove in vain.

[Price One Shilling.] EPISTLE TO WILLIAM WILBERFORCE, ESQ. ON THE REJECTION OF THE BILL FOR ABOLISHING THE SLAVE TRADE. BY ANNA LETITIA BARBAULD. LONDON: PRINTED FOR J. JOHNSON, NO 72, ST. PAULS CHURCH-YARD. M.DCC.XCI. EPISTLE TO WILLIAM WILBERFORCE, ESQ. CEASE, Wilberforce, to urge thy generous aim! Thy Country knows the sin, and stands the shame! The Preacher, Poet, Senator in vain Has rattled in her sight the Negro's chain; [ 6 ] With his deep groans assail'd her startled ear, And rent the veil that hid his constant tear; Forc'd her averted eyes his stripes to scan, Beneath the bloody scourge laid bare the man, Claimed Pity's tear, urged Conscience' strong controul, And flash'd conviction on her shrinking soul. The Muse, too soon awaked, with ready tongue At Mercy's shrine applausive peans rung; And Freedom's eager sons, in vain foretold A new Astrean reign, an age of gold: She knows and she persists—Still Afric bleeds, Uncheck'd, the human traffic still proceeds; She stamps her infamy to future time, And on her harden'd forehead seals the crime. [ 7 ] In vain, to thy white standard gathering round, Wit, Worth, and Parts and Eloquence are found: In vain, to push to birth thy great design, Contending chiefs, and hostile virtues join; All, from conflicting ranks, of power possest To rouse, to melt, or to inform the breast. Where seasoned tools of Avarice prevail, A Nation's eloquence, combined, must fail: Each flimsy sophistry by turns they try; The plausive argument, the daring lye, The artful gloss, that moral sense confounds, Th' acknowledged thirst of gain that honour wounds: Bane of ingenuous minds, th' unfeeling sneer, Which, sudden, turns to stone the falling tear: [ 8 ] They search assiduous, with inverted skill, For forms of wrong, and precedents of ill; With impious mockery wrest the sacred page, And glean up crimes from each remoter age: Wrung Nature's tortures, shuddering, while you tell, From scoffing fiends bursts forth the laugh of hell; In Britain's senate, Misery's pangs give birth To jests unseemly, and to horrid mirth— Forbear!—thy virtues but provoke our doom, And swell th' account of vengeance yet to come; For, not unmarked in Heaven's impartial plan, Shall man, proud worm, contemn his fellow-man? And injur'd Afric, by herself redrest, Darts her own serpents at her Tyrant's breast. [ 9 ] Each vice, to minds deprav'd by bondage known, With sure contagion fastens on his own; In sickly languors melts his nerveless frame, And blows to rage impetuous Passion's flame: Fermenting swift, the fiery venom gains The milky innocence of infant veins; There swells the stubborn will, damps learning's fire, The whirlwind wakes of uncontroul'd desire, Sears the young heart to images of woe, And blasts the buds of Virtue as they blow. Lo! where reclin'd, pale Beauty courts the breeze, Diffus'd on sofas of voluptuous ease; With anxious awe, her menial train around, Catch her faint whispers of half-utter'd sound; [ 10 ] See her, in monstrous fellowship, unite At once the Scythian, and the Sybarite; Blending repugnant vices, misally'd, Which frugal nature purpos'd to divide; See her, with indolence to fierceness join'd, Of body delicate, infirm of mind, With languid tones imperious mandates urge; With arm recumbent wield the household scourge; And with unruffled mien, and placid sounds, Contriving torture, and inflicting wounds.

3,Card_1792_1.txt,"A POEM ON THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE. ADDRESSED TO HER OWN SEX. BY M. BIRKETT. ""DISGUISE THYSELF AS THOU WILT, STILL, SLA- ""VERY, STILL THOU ART A BITTER CUP."" STERNE. THE SECOND EDITION. DUBLIN: PRINTED BY J. JONES, NO. 111, GRAFTON-STREET. M,DCC,XCII. PREFACE IN presenting this juvenile attempt to the eyes of the public, I am sensible how much I lay myself open to the censure of those, whose superior discernment shall point out all its er- rors in their full magnitude.—I can only hope that the merits of the cause will in part plead my excuse; for the rest, I submit to their candor. It is with the greatest diffidence that I pre- sume to offer, to indiscriminate inspection, a production of so little labour, which never ex- perienced the correcting hand of judgment, and which, overwhelmed with confusion, would shrink from the piercing eye of criticism—as the owl from the face of day. M. B. A POEM ON THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE. OPPRESSION! thou, whose hard and cruel chain, Entails on all thy victims woe and pain; Who gives with tyrant force and scorpion whip, The cup of mis'ry to a Negro's lip; Marks with stern frown thy wide, unhallow'd reign, And broods with gloomy wing o'er Afric's injur'd plain! ( 2 ) Thy voice which spreads pale desolation round, While trembling myriads groan beneath the sound, Thy voice more rude than Boreas' chilling breath, Calls thousands forth to feel a living death! Which in hoarse thunders bids injustice rise! While oft beneath the strokes the suff'rer dies: Yes! thy infernal voice impels my song, And o'er my soul its crude ideas throng; A sorrowing sympathy surrounds my heart, And mild compassion bleeds in every part. Mov'd at the dire distress my brethren know My mind in vain participates their woe; In vain for them I raise the fervent sigh; Ah! still they bleed!—they languish!—still they die! How little think the giddy and the gay While sipping o'er the sweets of charming tea, How oft with grief they pierce the manly breast, How oft their lux'ry robs the wretch of rest, And that to gain the plant we idly waste Th'extreme of human mis'ry they must taste! Yes! 'tis no lying fable I relate, Th'extreme of human mis'ry is their fate! ( 3 ) Let sordid traders call it what they will, Men must be men, possest with feelings still; And little boots a white or sable skin, To prove a fair inhabitant within. There are, oh! scandal to the Christian name, Who fierce of blood, and lost to sense of shame, Dare lave their hands impious in human gore, And barter living souls for lust of ore; More rav'nous than the foulest beasts of prey, They but from Nature's powerful cravings slay; More cruel than the thief, whose murd'rous knife At once deprives the trembling wretch of life: Him poverty, perchance, first taught to stray, And strongly urg'd her too prevailing plea; Yet him the justice of our laws condemn: Beasts we destroy, but seldom think of them. Strange paradox! we view with shrinking eye, The murd'rer's crime, and bid him justly die; But when our traders snatch a thousand lives, No pain, no punishment on them derives; The guilt's diminish'd, as increas'd its size, And they are clear—at least in mortal eyes. ( 4 ) Tell me, ye friends of slav'ry's shameful cause, Where shall I find the records—where the laws, Which give to man indubitable power To sell his brother, and the spoil devour? And whence do we th'infernal doctrine hold, To sell th'image of our God for gold? To our first parents when th'Almighty Cause Reveal'd his holy will—his hallow'd laws; When from his lips the wondrous accents broke, And mortals listen'd while the Godhead spoke; In that mysterious moment did he say? - "" Man shall his fellow ravage, sell, and slay; "" And one unhappy race shall always be "" Slave to another's pamper'd luxury."" There are, I know, who think and more who say, That not so injur'd—so opprest are they; That under master's just they earn their bread, And plenty crowns the board at which they're fed. Ah, sophist, vain thy subtle reas'ning's aim! Look at the Negro's sun-burnt, grief-worn frame! Examine well each limb, each nerve, each bone, Each artery—and then observe thy own; ( 5 ) The beating pulse, the heart that throbs within, All, (save the sable tincture of his skin,) Say, Christians, do they not resemble you? If so, their feelings and sensations too: One moment now with you his burthen rest, Then tell me, is he happy—is he blest? Lo! where on Afric's shore the sable youth, Feels each degree of honor, love, and truth; (Though he ne'er heard the gospel's joyful sound, Nor call'd on Jesus in his natal ground; Reproach him not, oh, follower of thy Lord, Who never knew the blessing of his word; Think on thy own forefathers savage lore, He keeps his inward guide, and dost thou more?) Rear'd in the lap of innocence and ease, Him simple Nature's genuine bounties please. For him no palace rears its costly head, Contented with an humble turf-built shed; On him no fawning lacqueys proudly wait, In all the pamper'd insolence of state; No harmless lives, his taste to gratify, Opprest with various torture slowly die. ( 6 ) And if his manners suit the savage name, Uneducated man is every where the same. There in that plain, when freedom was his guest, And social love glow'd in his faithful breast; Then when his soul youth's joyous feelings knew, And manhood, ripening manhood, rose to view; He to his parents eye perhaps appears, The only staff of their declining years; And he with ceaseless love and anxious care, Does oft for them the hunted food prepare: Perchance soft passion does his bosom move, And his fond nymph returns his constant love; Perhaps his offspring hail their honour'd sire, And each to gain the envy'd kiss aspire: On him a pleasing weight of cares attend, As father, husband, brother, son or friend: Haply the hour when their supply he sought, His soul with ev'ry warm affection fraught, As o'er the plain he chac'd his wonted prey, And hope deceitful cheer'd the toilsome way; When homeward now the lifeless prize he brought, Already greets the cot his rapid thought; ( 7 ) Him Christian traders see, his path surround, In vain his feet pursue their nimble bound; He's seiz'd and dragg'd along—in vain he cries, Starts, stamps the ground—now groans, now weeps, now sighs; And fill'd with all the agony of grief, Raves with despair—now supplicates relief: In vain he strives their pity to command, The ruffians hear, but will not understand; Deaf to th'heart-rending groan, the plaintive sigh, They view his misery with a stoic eye, And to the vessel haul the wretch along In chains to mingle with the suffering throng. Oh thou! whom more than all he loves beside, Friend of his heart! his chaste and faithful bride! What was thy anguish on that fatal day Which bore thy spouse from Afric far away! In vain for him thou heap'st the chearful fire; In vain thy little ones demand their sire; In vain thou chid'st his long delay!—go, mourn, For never must the youth thou lov'st return! ( 8 ) Lo, now the winds embrace the swelling sail, And the full bark salutes the rising gale; While now the desolated shore they leave, And for Jamaica cut the briny wave. While o'er the foaming sea their course they steal, Think what the Negroes suffer!—what they feel! Opprest with sickness, close confin'd they lie, No kind, no sympathising friend is nigh: Grim Death his jaws insatiate shews around, And bleeding Mem'ry opes the recent wound. Thrice happy they who feel his icy hand! No more they dread their tyrant's stern command; No more expos'd to insult and to pain, They drag along the hard and cruel chain; But their freed souls approach the throne of grace, To meet the proud oppressor face to face. Oh, tyrants, what will then your anguish be, When God and men shall your injustice see! And trust me that important day will come, Which fixes your irrevocable doom, When all your basely murder'd slaves shall rise, And publish all your crimes throughout the skies. ( 9 ) Here cease, oh Muse! nor dare the secret tell, The dread event, which but with God must dwell. Now turn our eye to India's sultry shore, And tell, oh! tell me, are their sorrows o'er? The bark arrives, with those who yet remain, They drag to land the feebly tott'ring train: Their squalid look, and meagre form declare The soul opprest with sickness, grief and care. I pass the complicated scenes of woe Which these sad vassals of our lux'ry know: Their sickness, fatt'ning, shameful market, past, And now for life the dreadful die is cast. Grant a mild master kindly treats them well, (Few such there are—and they who know can tell); Grant that those masters plenteous meals prepare, (Though well 'tis known their food is scant and bare); Yet then, even then, can comfort on them wait, Depress'd, degraded to a servile state? And they once chieftans in their native land, Shackled, in chains, and trembling at command; ( 10 ) Naked, exposed to Phoebus' piercing beams, And yok'd (as horse or oxen) to the teams; Dead to remorse, the overseer stands by, And oft does he the sounding lash apply. So Pharaoh's task-masters of yore opprest Old Jacob's seed—and thus the flock distrest. Now dead to hope they see resistance vain, They in their manly breasts conceal their pain; A silent grief to furious rage succeeds, And by resentment stung—their whole soul bleeds. Firm in despair their hands refuse the yoke, We call them stubborn—and apply the stroke; Their reeking backs the dire correction shew, Yet they unmov'd, nor fear nor tremor know; Their strength heroic claims a nobler name, And shews not their's—but their oppressor's shame. Say not, that if not humbled they rebel; Tyrant! the cause, the guilt with thee must dwell; For when they view the authors of their woe, No wonder if fierce passion aims the blow! They all their blasted hopes and comforts see, Condemn'd to linger life in misery. ( 11 ) What son of thine, oh Albion, would bow down, Would tremble at the upstart planter's frown? What son of thine, oh Albion, thus opprest, Nor feel revenge inflame his haughty breast? They not the joys of mild Religion know, The ransom'd soul they to a Saviour owe. For this, oh Britain, shall I dare to blame, Nor can I with the Turk enrol thy name. The Turk to Mah'met would convert his slave; He gives him freedom and his soul would save: The Spaniards to the mine their vassals send, But first the rites of baptism them attend: Our Albion, when opprest her captives lie, Shews not the way to suffer and to die; Nor gives the gospel to each erring mind, Nor points to Jesus merciful and kind. Ah, Negro, think not hardly of our God, Tho' high o'er thee affliction lifts her rod; Ill do his followers ways his goodness prove, Whose laws breathe mercy and whose precepts love; And ill our manners with our maxims suit, These dignify—while those degrade us to the brute. ( 12 ) Lysander, did I really hear thee say, Self-preservation bids us on them prey, Or what vast nation could supply the bread, For such encreasing myriads to be fed! Think'st thou that form'd on this erroneous plan The world was made—and God's last, best work— man? Think'st thou that He who erst seven thousand fill'd, With what a few small loaves and fishes yield, Think'st thou he's insufficient to supply, Who hears the tender raven's croaking cry? ""Must we abandon then, Camillus cries, ""The wealth abundant which in Afric lies? ""Shall our fam'd commerce languish and decay, ""And we no more send fleets for slaves away?"" No, wise Camillus, search her fertile land, Let the mild rays of commerce there expand; Her plains abound in ore, in fruits her soil, And the rich plain scarce needs the ploughman's toil; Thy vessels crown'd with olive branches send, And make each injur'd African thy friend: ( 13 ) So tides of wealth by peace and justice got, Oh, philanthropic heart! will be thy lot. Plant there our colonies, and to their soul, Declare the God who form'd this boundless whole; Improve their manners—teach them how to live, To them the useful lore of science give; So shall with us their praise and glory rest, And we in blessing be supremely blest; For 'tis a duty which we surely owe, We to the Romans were what to us Afric now. Hibernian fair, who own compassion's sway, Scorn not a younger sister's artless lay; To you the Muse would raise her daring song, For Mercy's softest beams to you belong; To you the sympathetic sigh is known, And Charity's sweet lustre—all your own; To you gall'd Mis'ry seldom pleads in vain, Oh, let us rise and burst the Negro's chain! Yes, sisters, yes, to us the task belongs, 'Tis we increase or mitigate their wrongs. If we the produce of their toils refuse, If we no more the blood-stain'd lux'ry choose; ( 14 ) If from our lips we push the plant away For which the liberties of thousands pay, Of thousands once as blest, and born as free, And nurs'd with care, (tho' not so soft,) as we; If in benev'lence firm, we this can dare, And in our brethrens sufferings hold no share, In no small part their long-borne pangs will cease, And we to souls unborn may whisper peace. Sisters! another theme, did fancy choose, Far from your view had shrunk my blushing Muse; And still from you conceal'd my trembling form, But here—I must, I dare, I will be warm - Shall we who dwell in pleasure, peace and ease, Shall we who but in meekness, mildness please, Shall we surrounded by each dear delight, To soothe the heart, or gratify the sight, Say, shall for us the sable sufferers sigh? Say, shall for us so many victims die? Shall still for us the sable maid bewail? Shall still the doating parent's fondness fail? Shall groans for ever ring thro' Afric's grove, Of deep distess and disappointed love? ( 15 ) Oh, how would thorns of care enthral each breast, How would it rob the passing hours of rest, If from our arms our nearest kindred torn, And we for ever doom'd their loss to mourn? No, let Ierne's gentle daughters prove The kindling force of sympathetic love; Now shew their virtues, be humane indeed, And plead for those ""who have no power to plead."" Say not that small's the sphere in which we move, And our attempts would vain and fruitless prove; Not so—we hold a most important share, In all the evils—all the wrongs they bear, And tho' their woes entire we can't remove, We may th'increasing mis'ries which they prove, Push far away the plant for which they die, And in this one small thing our taste deny; We must, we ought, 'tis Justice points the way; Mercy and Charity loudly call—""obey."" Can you refuse to soothe, methinks they cry, The heart of sorrow, or bid cease the sigh? Can you whom plenty, wealth and peace surround, Who in society's mild joys abound? ( 16 ) Commerce to you does its choice stores impart, With all the gifts of Nature and of Art; For you gay Flora animates the scene, And spreads with vast parterres the smiling green; Her mingled pow'rs and varied charms unite, And does each sense—not satiate but delight; On you brown Ceres sheds her richest powers, Pomona's fruits nectareous—all are yours; For you Hygeia, maid of blooming mien, With joy abounding, fills the mirthful scene; Can you whose hearts these heav'n-crown'd blessings feel, Refuse one sacrifice their wounds to heal? A plant of which 'tis lux'ry gives the use, Which our sad brethrens slav'ry does produce! No, daughters of Ierne, you will give This self-denying proof and bid them live! See where Religion's holy banners rise, And to your view presents immortal skies! List, for methinks I hear the Matron say, Can you whose hearts confess my hallow'd sway; Can you before my altar bow the knee, And yet refuse to set a brother free? ( 17 ) In humble faith you hope for heaven's high crown, Yet press with grief so many spirits down: ""Preserve us, Lord, from evil,"" can you pray, Yet wilfully pursue the evil way? And how can you his blessing think to prove, Whose first, best law is universal love? Man was his fav'rite work—he form'd him free; His fav'rite work whate'er his colour be; And far more dark's the sinful soul within, Than the poor harmless Negro's sable skin. ""Strange!"" cries Flavilla, ""if so foul the trade, ""Why has wise heaven its thunders thus delay'd? ""And if the traffic of mankind were wrong, ""Would heaven's dread Lord have suffer'd it so long? ""Sure rather he'd his sore displeasure shew, ""And crush the tyrants 'neath his vengeful blow."" Shalt thou, Flavilla, with too curious eye, In his mysterious causes dare to pry? Shalt thou, short-sighted mortal, wish to know, Why thus thy Maker orders things below? Ask why the thief who steals thy purse away, Still feels the warm reviving light of day? ( 18 ) Ask why the wretch who lifts the murd'ring knife, (Escap'd thy search) still breathes the air of life? Or, ask why he who robs the houseless poor, In safety yet enjoys his ill-got store? Or why throughout the globe's capacious round, Virtue oft droops where Vice is prosp'rous found? Seek not the hidden ways of God to know, Sure is his justice though 'tis often slow. Enough for us—his mercy suffers long, And man's free will may chuse or right or wrong; His sacred judgments are reserv'd in store, 'Tis ours to chuse the right—and silently adore. Oh! may that Power, whose wondrous wisdom wrought Myriads of worlds, with beauteous order fraught, Whose fingers gave to heav'n's wide arch its bound, And scatter'd those fair orbs which glitter round; Who bade the moon to shine each night—each day The sun to cheer us by his vital ray; At whose command the rolling thunders rise, And livid lightnings flash through blazing skies, Whose word creative peopled earth with charms, Whose grace preserves us and whose bounty warms: ( 19 ) May the mild dictates of his love impart The path of virtue to each wand'ring heart! Before him flee the mists of error blind, And Truth's whole force irradiates all the mind. So when Aurora through the gates of night, Leads forth the ruddy blaze of opening light, Bursts o'er the horizon with golden fire, And bids the hovering shades of night expire; Her foot-steps chase the sable clouds away, And usher in the glorious light of day.

PREFACE IN presenting this juvenile attempt to the eyes of the public, I am sensible how much I lay myself open to the censure of those, whose superior discernment shall point out all its er- rors in their full magnitude.—I can only hope that the merits of the cause will in part plead my excuse; for the rest, I submit to their candor. It is with the greatest diffidence that I pre- sume to offer, to indiscriminate inspection, a production of so little labour, which never ex- perienced the correcting hand of judgment, and which, overwhelmed with confusion, would shrink from the piercing eye of criticism—as the owl from the face of day. M. B. A POEM ON THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE. OPPRESSION! thou, whose hard and cruel chain, Entails on all thy victims woe and pain; Who gives with tyrant force and scorpion whip, The cup of mis'ry to a Negro's lip; Marks with stern frown thy wide, unhallow'd reign, And broods with gloomy wing o'er Afric's injur'd plain! ( 2 ) Thy voice which spreads pale desolation round, While trembling myriads groan beneath the sound, Thy voice more rude than Boreas' chilling breath, Calls thousands forth to feel a living death! Which in hoarse thunders bids injustice rise! While oft beneath the strokes the suff'rer dies: Yes! thy infernal voice impels my song, And o'er my soul its crude ideas throng; A sorrowing sympathy surrounds my heart, And mild compassion bleeds in every part. Mov'd at the dire distress my brethren know My mind in vain participates their woe; In vain for them I raise the fervent sigh; Ah! still they bleed!—they languish!—still they die! How little think the giddy and the gay While sipping o'er the sweets of charming tea, How oft with grief they pierce the manly breast, How oft their lux'ry robs the wretch of rest, And that to gain the plant we idly waste Th'extreme of human mis'ry they must taste! Yes! 'tis no lying fable I relate, Th'extreme of human mis'ry is their fate! ( 3 ) Let sordid traders call it what they will, Men must be men, possest with feelings still; And little boots a white or sable skin, To prove a fair inhabitant within. There are, oh! scandal to the Christian name, Who fierce of blood, and lost to sense of shame, Dare lave their hands impious in human gore, And barter living souls for lust of ore; More rav'nous than the foulest beasts of prey, They but from Nature's powerful cravings slay; More cruel than the thief, whose murd'rous knife At once deprives the trembling wretch of life: Him poverty, perchance, first taught to stray, And strongly urg'd her too prevailing plea; Yet him the justice of our laws condemn: Beasts we destroy, but seldom think of them. Strange paradox! we view with shrinking eye, The murd'rer's crime, and bid him justly die; But when our traders snatch a thousand lives, No pain, no punishment on them derives; The guilt's diminish'd, as increas'd its size, And they are clear—at least in mortal eyes. ( 4 ) Tell me, ye friends of slav'ry's shameful cause, Where shall I find the records—where the laws, Which give to man indubitable power To sell his brother, and the spoil devour? And whence do we th'infernal doctrine hold, To sell th'image of our God for gold? To our first parents when th'Almighty Cause Reveal'd his holy will—his hallow'd laws; When from his lips the wondrous accents broke, And mortals listen'd while the Godhead spoke; In that mysterious moment did he say? - "" Man shall his fellow ravage, sell, and slay; "" And one unhappy race shall always be "" Slave to another's pamper'd luxury."" There are, I know, who think and more who say, That not so injur'd—so opprest are they; That under master's just they earn their bread, And plenty crowns the board at which they're fed. Ah, sophist, vain thy subtle reas'ning's aim! Look at the Negro's sun-burnt, grief-worn frame! Examine well each limb, each nerve, each bone, Each artery—and then observe thy own; ( 5 ) The beating pulse, the heart that throbs within, All, (save the sable tincture of his skin,) Say, Christians, do they not resemble you? If so, their feelings and sensations too: One moment now with you his burthen rest, Then tell me, is he happy—is he blest? Lo! where on Afric's shore the sable youth, Feels each degree of honor, love, and truth; (Though he ne'er heard the gospel's joyful sound, Nor call'd on Jesus in his natal ground; Reproach him not, oh, follower of thy Lord, Who never knew the blessing of his word; Think on thy own forefathers savage lore, He keeps his inward guide, and dost thou more?) Rear'd in the lap of innocence and ease, Him simple Nature's genuine bounties please. For him no palace rears its costly head, Contented with an humble turf-built shed; On him no fawning lacqueys proudly wait, In all the pamper'd insolence of state; No harmless lives, his taste to gratify, Opprest with various torture slowly die. ( 6 ) And if his manners suit the savage name, Uneducated man is every where the same. There in that plain, when freedom was his guest, And social love glow'd in his faithful breast; Then when his soul youth's joyous feelings knew, And manhood, ripening manhood, rose to view; He to his parents eye perhaps appears, The only staff of their declining years; And he with ceaseless love and anxious care, Does oft for them the hunted food prepare: Perchance soft passion does his bosom move, And his fond nymph returns his constant love; Perhaps his offspring hail their honour'd sire, And each to gain the envy'd kiss aspire: On him a pleasing weight of cares attend, As father, husband, brother, son or friend: Haply the hour when their supply he sought, His soul with ev'ry warm affection fraught, As o'er the plain he chac'd his wonted prey, And hope deceitful cheer'd the toilsome way; When homeward now the lifeless prize he brought, Already greets the cot his rapid thought; ( 7 ) Him Christian traders see, his path surround, In vain his feet pursue their nimble bound; He's seiz'd and dragg'd along—in vain he cries, Starts, stamps the ground—now groans, now weeps, now sighs; And fill'd with all the agony of grief, Raves with despair—now supplicates relief: In vain he strives their pity to command, The ruffians hear, but will not understand; Deaf to th'heart-rending groan, the plaintive sigh, They view his misery with a stoic eye, And to the vessel haul the wretch along In chains to mingle with the suffering throng. Oh thou! whom more than all he loves beside, Friend of his heart! his chaste and faithful bride! What was thy anguish on that fatal day Which bore thy spouse from Afric far away! In vain for him thou heap'st the chearful fire; In vain thy little ones demand their sire; In vain thou chid'st his long delay!—go, mourn, For never must the youth thou lov'st return! ( 8 ) Lo, now the winds embrace the swelling sail, And the full bark salutes the rising gale; While now the desolated shore they leave, And for Jamaica cut the briny wave. While o'er the foaming sea their course they steal, Think what the Negroes suffer!—what they feel! Opprest with sickness, close confin'd they lie, No kind, no sympathising friend is nigh: Grim Death his jaws insatiate shews around, And bleeding Mem'ry opes the recent wound. Thrice happy they who feel his icy hand! No more they dread their tyrant's stern command; No more expos'd to insult and to pain, They drag along the hard and cruel chain; But their freed souls approach the throne of grace, To meet the proud oppressor face to face. Oh, tyrants, what will then your anguish be, When God and men shall your injustice see! And trust me that important day will come, Which fixes your irrevocable doom, When all your basely murder'd slaves shall rise, And publish all your crimes throughout the skies. ( 9 ) Here cease, oh Muse! nor dare the secret tell, The dread event, which but with God must dwell. Now turn our eye to India's sultry shore, And tell, oh! tell me, are their sorrows o'er? The bark arrives, with those who yet remain, They drag to land the feebly tott'ring train: Their squalid look, and meagre form declare The soul opprest with sickness, grief and care. I pass the complicated scenes of woe Which these sad vassals of our lux'ry know: Their sickness, fatt'ning, shameful market, past, And now for life the dreadful die is cast. Grant a mild master kindly treats them well, (Few such there are—and they who know can tell); Grant that those masters plenteous meals prepare, (Though well 'tis known their food is scant and bare); Yet then, even then, can comfort on them wait, Depress'd, degraded to a servile state? And they once chieftans in their native land, Shackled, in chains, and trembling at command; ( 10 ) Naked, exposed to Phoebus' piercing beams, And yok'd (as horse or oxen) to the teams; Dead to remorse, the overseer stands by, And oft does he the sounding lash apply. So Pharaoh's task-masters of yore opprest Old Jacob's seed—and thus the flock distrest. Now dead to hope they see resistance vain, They in their manly breasts conceal their pain; A silent grief to furious rage succeeds, And by resentment stung—their whole soul bleeds. Firm in despair their hands refuse the yoke, We call them stubborn—and apply the stroke; Their reeking backs the dire correction shew, Yet they unmov'd, nor fear nor tremor know; Their strength heroic claims a nobler name, And shews not their's—but their oppressor's shame. Say not, that if not humbled they rebel; Tyrant! the cause, the guilt with thee must dwell; For when they view the authors of their woe, No wonder if fierce passion aims the blow! They all their blasted hopes and comforts see, Condemn'd to linger life in misery. ( 11 ) What son of thine, oh Albion, would bow down, Would tremble at the upstart planter's frown? What son of thine, oh Albion, thus opprest, Nor feel revenge inflame his haughty breast? They not the joys of mild Religion know, The ransom'd soul they to a Saviour owe. For this, oh Britain, shall I dare to blame, Nor can I with the Turk enrol thy name. The Turk to Mah'met would convert his slave; He gives him freedom and his soul would save: The Spaniards to the mine their vassals send, But first the rites of baptism them attend: Our Albion, when opprest her captives lie, Shews not the way to suffer and to die; Nor gives the gospel to each erring mind, Nor points to Jesus merciful and kind. Ah, Negro, think not hardly of our God, Tho' high o'er thee affliction lifts her rod; Ill do his followers ways his goodness prove, Whose laws breathe mercy and whose precepts love; And ill our manners with our maxims suit, These dignify—while those degrade us to the brute. ( 12 ) Lysander, did I really hear thee say, Self-preservation bids us on them prey, Or what vast nation could supply the bread, For such encreasing myriads to be fed! Think'st thou that form'd on this erroneous plan The world was made—and God's last, best work— man? Think'st thou that He who erst seven thousand fill'd, With what a few small loaves and fishes yield, Think'st thou he's insufficient to supply, Who hears the tender raven's croaking cry? ""Must we abandon then, Camillus cries, ""The wealth abundant which in Afric lies? ""Shall our fam'd commerce languish and decay, ""And we no more send fleets for slaves away?"" No, wise Camillus, search her fertile land, Let the mild rays of commerce there expand; Her plains abound in ore, in fruits her soil, And the rich plain scarce needs the ploughman's toil; Thy vessels crown'd with olive branches send, And make each injur'd African thy friend: ( 13 ) So tides of wealth by peace and justice got, Oh, philanthropic heart! will be thy lot. Plant there our colonies, and to their soul, Declare the God who form'd this boundless whole; Improve their manners—teach them how to live, To them the useful lore of science give; So shall with us their praise and glory rest, And we in blessing be supremely blest; For 'tis a duty which we surely owe, We to the Romans were what to us Afric now. Hibernian fair, who own compassion's sway, Scorn not a younger sister's artless lay; To you the Muse would raise her daring song, For Mercy's softest beams to you belong; To you the sympathetic sigh is known, And Charity's sweet lustre—all your own; To you gall'd Mis'ry seldom pleads in vain, Oh, let us rise and burst the Negro's chain! Yes, sisters, yes, to us the task belongs, 'Tis we increase or mitigate their wrongs. If we the produce of their toils refuse, If we no more the blood-stain'd lux'ry choose; ( 14 ) If from our lips we push the plant away For which the liberties of thousands pay, Of thousands once as blest, and born as free, And nurs'd with care, (tho' not so soft,) as we; If in benev'lence firm, we this can dare, And in our brethrens sufferings hold no share, In no small part their long-borne pangs will cease, And we to souls unborn may whisper peace. Sisters! another theme, did fancy choose, Far from your view had shrunk my blushing Muse; And still from you conceal'd my trembling form, But here—I must, I dare, I will be warm - Shall we who dwell in pleasure, peace and ease, Shall we who but in meekness, mildness please, Shall we surrounded by each dear delight, To soothe the heart, or gratify the sight, Say, shall for us the sable sufferers sigh? Say, shall for us so many victims die? Shall still for us the sable maid bewail? Shall still the doating parent's fondness fail? Shall groans for ever ring thro' Afric's grove, Of deep distess and disappointed love? ( 15 ) Oh, how would thorns of care enthral each breast, How would it rob the passing hours of rest, If from our arms our nearest kindred torn, And we for ever doom'd their loss to mourn? No, let Ierne's gentle daughters prove The kindling force of sympathetic love; Now shew their virtues, be humane indeed, And plead for those ""who have no power to plead."" Say not that small's the sphere in which we move, And our attempts would vain and fruitless prove; Not so—we hold a most important share, In all the evils—all the wrongs they bear, And tho' their woes entire we can't remove, We may th'increasing mis'ries which they prove, Push far away the plant for which they die, And in this one small thing our taste deny; We must, we ought, 'tis Justice points the way; Mercy and Charity loudly call—""obey."" Can you refuse to soothe, methinks they cry, The heart of sorrow, or bid cease the sigh? Can you whom plenty, wealth and peace surround, Who in society's mild joys abound? ( 16 ) Commerce to you does its choice stores impart, With all the gifts of Nature and of Art; For you gay Flora animates the scene, And spreads with vast parterres the smiling green; Her mingled pow'rs and varied charms unite, And does each sense—not satiate but delight; On you brown Ceres sheds her richest powers, Pomona's fruits nectareous—all are yours; For you Hygeia, maid of blooming mien, With joy abounding, fills the mirthful scene; Can you whose hearts these heav'n-crown'd blessings feel, Refuse one sacrifice their wounds to heal? A plant of which 'tis lux'ry gives the use, Which our sad brethrens slav'ry does produce! No, daughters of Ierne, you will give This self-denying proof and bid them live! See where Religion's holy banners rise, And to your view presents immortal skies! List, for methinks I hear the Matron say, Can you whose hearts confess my hallow'd sway; Can you before my altar bow the knee, And yet refuse to set a brother free? ( 17 ) In humble faith you hope for heaven's high crown, Yet press with grief so many spirits down: ""Preserve us, Lord, from evil,"" can you pray, Yet wilfully pursue the evil way? And how can you his blessing think to prove, Whose first, best law is universal love? Man was his fav'rite work—he form'd him free; His fav'rite work whate'er his colour be; And far more dark's the sinful soul within, Than the poor harmless Negro's sable skin. ""Strange!"" cries Flavilla, ""if so foul the trade, ""Why has wise heaven its thunders thus delay'd? ""And if the traffic of mankind were wrong, ""Would heaven's dread Lord have suffer'd it so long? ""Sure rather he'd his sore displeasure shew, ""And crush the tyrants 'neath his vengeful blow."" Shalt thou, Flavilla, with too curious eye, In his mysterious causes dare to pry? Shalt thou, short-sighted mortal, wish to know, Why thus thy Maker orders things below? Ask why the thief who steals thy purse away, Still feels the warm reviving light of day? ( 18 ) Ask why the wretch who lifts the murd'ring knife, (Escap'd thy search) still breathes the air of life? Or, ask why he who robs the houseless poor, In safety yet enjoys his ill-got store? Or why throughout the globe's capacious round, Virtue oft droops where Vice is prosp'rous found? Seek not the hidden ways of God to know, Sure is his justice though 'tis often slow. Enough for us—his mercy suffers long, And man's free will may chuse or right or wrong; His sacred judgments are reserv'd in store, 'Tis ours to chuse the right—and silently adore. Oh! may that Power, whose wondrous wisdom wrought Myriads of worlds, with beauteous order fraught, Whose fingers gave to heav'n's wide arch its bound, And scatter'd those fair orbs which glitter round; Who bade the moon to shine each night—each day The sun to cheer us by his vital ray; At whose command the rolling thunders rise, And livid lightnings flash through blazing skies, Whose word creative peopled earth with charms, Whose grace preserves us and whose bounty warms: ( 19 ) May the mild dictates of his love impart The path of virtue to each wand'ring heart! Before him flee the mists of error blind, And Truth's whole force irradiates all the mind. So when Aurora through the gates of night, Leads forth the ruddy blaze of opening light, Bursts o'er the horizon with golden fire, And bids the hovering shades of night expire; Her foot-steps chase the sable clouds away, And usher in the glorious light of day.

( 3 ) ************ ************ ************ THE Sorrows of Yamba, &c. To the Tune of Hosier's Ghost. ""In St. Lucie's distant isle, Still with Afric's love I burn; Parted many a thousand mile, Never, never to return. Come, kind death! and give me rest, Yamba has no friend but thee; Thou can'st ease my throbbing breast, Thou can'st set the Prisoner free. Down my cheeks the tears are dripping, Broken is my heart with grief; Mangled my poor flesh with whipping, Come kind death! and bring relief. Born on Afric's Golden Coast, Once I was as blest as you; Parents tender I could boast, Husband dear, and children too. ( 4 ) Whity Man he came from far, Sailing o'er the briny flood, Who, with help of British Tar, Buys up human flesh and blood. With the Baby at my breast (Other two were sleeping by) In my Hut I sat at rest, With no thought of danger nigh. From the Bush at even tide Rush'd the fierce man-stealing Crew; Seiz'd the Children by my side, Seiz'd the wretched Yamba too. ************ ************ ************ Then for love of filthy Gold, Strait they bore me to the sea; Cramm'd me down a Slave Ship's hold, Where were Hundreds stow'd like me. ( 5 ) Naked on the Platform lying, Now we cross the tumbling wave; Shrieking, sickening, fainting, dying, Deed of shame for Britons brave. At the savage Captain's beck, Now like Brutes they make us prance; Smack the Cat about the Deck, And in scorn they bid us dance. Nauseous horse beans they bring nigh, Sick and sad we cannot eat; Cat must cure the Sulks they cry, Down their throats we'll force the meat. ************ ************ ************ I in groaning passed the night, And did roll my aching head; At the break of morning light, My poor Child was cold and dead. ( 6 ) Happy, happy, there she lies, ""Thou shalt feel the lash no more, Thus full many a Negro dies 'Ere we reach the destin'd shore. Thee, sweet infant, none shall sell, Thou hast gained a wat'ry Grave Clean escap'd the Tyrants fell, While thy mother lives a Slave. Driven like Cattle to a fair, See they sell us young and old; Child from Mother too they tear, All for love of filthy Gold. ************ ************ ************ I was sold to Massa hard, Some have Massas kind and good; And again my back was scarr'd, Bad and stinted was my food. ( 7 ) Poor and wounded, faint and sick, All expos'd to burning sky, Massa bids me grass to pick, And I now am near to die. What and if to death he send me, Savage murder tho' it be, British Law shall ne'er befriend me, They protect not Slaves like me."" Mourning thus my wretched state, (Ne'er may I forget the day) Once in dusk of evening late, Far from home I dar'd to stray; Dar'd, alas! with impious haste Tow'rds the roaring Sea to fly; Death itself I long'd to taste, Long'd to cast me in and Die. There I met upon the Strand English Missionary Good, He had Bible book in hand, Which poor me no understood. Led by pity from afar He had left his native ground; Thus if some inflict a scar, Others fly to cure the wound. ( 8 ) Strait he pull'd me from the shore, Bid me no self-murder do; Talk'd of state when life is o'er, All from Bible good and true. Then he led me to his Cot, Sooth'd and pity'd all my woe; Told me 'twas the Christian's lot Much to suffer here below. Told me then of God's dear Son, (Strange and wond'rous is the story;) What sad wrong to him was done, Tho' he was the Lord of Glory. Told me too, like one who knew him, (Can such love as this be true?) How he died for them that slew him, Died for wretched Yamba too. Freely he his mercy proffer'd, And to Sinners he was sent; E'en to Massa pardon's offer'd; O if Massa would repent! Wicked deed full many a time Sinful Yamba too hath done But she wails to God her crime, But she trusts his only Son. ( 9 ) O ye slaves whom Massas beat, Ye are stained with guilt within; As ye hope for mercy sweet, So forgive your Massas' sin. And with grief when sinking low, Mark the Road that Yamba trod; Think how all her pain and woe Brought the Captive home to God. Now let Yamba too adore Gracious Heaven's mysterious Plan; Now I'll count thy mercies o'er, Flowing thro' the guilt of man. Now I'll bless my cruel capture, (Hence I've known a Saviour's name) Till my Grief is turn'd to Rapture, And I half forget the blame. But tho' here a Convert rare Thanks her God for Grace divine, Let not man the glory share, Sinner, still the guilt is thine. Here an injured Slave forgives, There a Host for vengeance cry; Here a single Yamba lives, There a thousand droop and die. ( 10 ) ************ ************ ************ Duly now baptiz'd am I By good Missionary Man; Lord my nature purify As no outward water can! All my former thoughts abhorr'd, Teach me now to pray and praise; Joy and Glory in my Lord, Trust and serve him all my days. Worn indeed with Grief and pain, Death I now will welcome in: O the Heavenly Prize to gain! O to 'scape the power of Sin! True of heart, and meek and lowly, Pure and blameless let me grow! Holy may I be, for Holy, Is the place to which I go. ( 11 ) But tho' death this hour may find me, Still with Afric's love I burn, (There I've left a spouse behind me) Still to native land I turn. And when Yamba sinks in Death, This my latest prayer shall be, While I yield my parting breath, O that Afric might be free. Cease, ye British Sons of murder! Cease from forging Afric's Chain; Mock your Saviour's name no further, Cease your savage lust of gain. Ye that boast ""Ye rule the waves,"" Bid no Slave Ship soil the sea, Ye that ""never will be slaves,"" Bid poor Afric's land be free. Where ye gave to war it's birth, Where your traders fix'd their den, There go publish ""Peace on Earth,"" Go proclaim ""good-will to men."" Where ye once have carried slaughter, Vice, and Slavery, and Sin; Seiz'd on Husband, Wife, and Daughter, Let the Gospel enter in. ( 12 ) Thus where Yamba's native home, Humble Hut of Rushes stood, Oh if there should chance to roam Some dear Missionary good; Thou in Afric's distant land, Still shalt see the man I love; Join him to the Christian band, Guide his Soul to Realms above. There no Fiend again shall sever Those whom God hath join'd and blest: There they dwell with Him for ever, There ""the weary are at rest.""

Nauseous horse beans they bring nigh, Sick and sad we cannot eat; Cat must cure the Sulks they cry, Down their throats we'll force the meat. ************ ************ ************ I in groaning passed the night, And did roll my aching head; At the break of morning light, My poor Child was cold and dead. ( 6 ) Happy, happy, there she lies, ""Thou shalt feel the lash no more, Thus full many a Negro dies 'Ere we reach the destin'd shore. Thee, sweet infant, none shall sell, Thou hast gained a wat'ry Grave Clean escap'd the Tyrants fell, While thy mother lives a Slave. Driven like Cattle to a fair, See they sell us young and old; Child from Mother too they tear, All for love of filthy Gold. ************ ************ ************ I was sold to Massa hard, Some have Massas kind and good; And again my back was scarr'd, Bad and stinted was my food. ( 7 ) Poor and wounded, faint and sick, All expos'd to burning sky, Massa bids me grass to pick, And I now am near to die. What and if to death he send me, Savage murder tho' it be, British Law shall ne'er befriend me, They protect not Slaves like me."" Mourning thus my wretched state, (Ne'er may I forget the day) Once in dusk of evening late, Far from home I dar'd to stray; Dar'd, alas! with impious haste Tow'rds the roaring Sea to fly; Death itself I long'd to taste, Long'd to cast me in and Die. There I met upon the Strand English Missionary Good, He had Bible book in hand, Which poor me no understood. Led by pity from afar He had left his native ground; Thus if some inflict a scar, Others fly to cure the wound. ( 8 ) Strait he pull'd me from the shore, Bid me no self-murder do; Talk'd of state when life is o'er, All from Bible good and true. Then he led me to his Cot, Sooth'd and pity'd all my woe; Told me 'twas the Christian's lot Much to suffer here below. Told me then of God's dear Son, (Strange and wond'rous is the story;) What sad wrong to him was done, Tho' he was the Lord of Glory. Told me too, like one who knew him, (Can such love as this be true?) How he died for them that slew him, Died for wretched Yamba too. Freely he his mercy proffer'd, And to Sinners he was sent; E'en to Massa pardon's offer'd; O if Massa would repent! Wicked deed full many a time Sinful Yamba too hath done But she wails to God her crime, But she trusts his only Son. ( 9 ) O ye slaves whom Massas beat, Ye are stained with guilt within; As ye hope for mercy sweet, So forgive your Massas' sin. And with grief when sinking low, Mark the Road that Yamba trod; Think how all her pain and woe Brought the Captive home to God. Now let Yamba too adore Gracious Heaven's mysterious Plan; Now I'll count thy mercies o'er, Flowing thro' the guilt of man. Now I'll bless my cruel capture, (Hence I've known a Saviour's name) Till my Grief is turn'd to Rapture, And I half forget the blame. But tho' here a Convert rare Thanks her God for Grace divine, Let not man the glory share, Sinner, still the guilt is thine. Here an injured Slave forgives, There a Host for vengeance cry; Here a single Yamba lives, There a thousand droop and die. ( 10 ) ************ ************ ************ Duly now baptiz'd am I By good Missionary Man; Lord my nature purify As no outward water can! All my former thoughts abhorr'd, Teach me now to pray and praise; Joy and Glory in my Lord, Trust and serve him all my days. Worn indeed with Grief and pain, Death I now will welcome in: O the Heavenly Prize to gain! O to 'scape the power of Sin! True of heart, and meek and lowly, Pure and blameless let me grow! Holy may I be, for Holy, Is the place to which I go. ( 11 ) But tho' death this hour may find me, Still with Afric's love I burn, (There I've left a spouse behind me) Still to native land I turn. And when Yamba sinks in Death, This my latest prayer shall be, While I yield my parting breath, O that Afric might be free. Cease, ye British Sons of murder! Cease from forging Afric's Chain; Mock your Saviour's name no further, Cease your savage lust of gain. Ye that boast ""Ye rule the waves,"" Bid no Slave Ship soil the sea, Ye that ""never will be slaves,"" Bid poor Afric's land be free. Where ye gave to war it's birth, Where your traders fix'd their den, There go publish ""Peace on Earth,"" Go proclaim ""good-will to men."" Where ye once have carried slaughter, Vice, and Slavery, and Sin; Seiz'd on Husband, Wife, and Daughter, Let the Gospel enter in. ( 12 ) Thus where Yamba's native home, Humble Hut of Rushes stood, Oh if there should chance to roam Some dear Missionary good; Thou in Afric's distant land, Still shalt see the man I love; Join him to the Christian band, Guide his Soul to Realms above. There no Fiend again shall sever Those whom God hath join'd and blest: There they dwell with Him for ever, There ""the weary are at rest.""

If any Man be found stealing any of his Brethren, and maketh Merchandise of him, or selleth him, then the Thief shall die, and thou shalt put away Evil from among you. Deut. xxiv. 7. LONDON: Printed for Messrs. EGERTONS, Charing-Cross; Mr. MURRAY, Temple-Bar; and Mr. J. JOHNSON, No. 72, St. Paul's Church-yard M.DCC.LXXXVIII TO HER GRACE THE Dutchess of DEVONSHIRE. MADAM, Honoured with the protection of your Grace, we have ventured to present the following little pieces to the public, confident that your approbation is sufficient to recommend them. Of your impar- vi DEDICATION. tial generosity we have recieved a most indisputable proof, by this favour you have condescended to confer upon us, who were personally strangers to your Grace, and whose sole recommendation was an attachment to the muses. This circumstance alone will afford ample testimony of your regard to the interests of literature, while the attention you have paid to the subject of these poems reflects the truest honour on your sensibility. However, therefore, the faults of this DEDICATION. vii publication may be thought worthy of censure, we have the satisfaction to know that is possesses one merit, as our taste will certainly be commended in the choice of a patron so illustrious. We have the Honour to be, With the profoundest Respect, Your Grace's most obliged, And most humble Servants, M. and H.FALCONAR. ( 1 ) SLAVERY. A POEM. BY MARIA FALCONAR. HAIL, soft Philanthropy, to thee I sing Blest source, whence all our social pleasures spring; When every Muse bends prostrate at thy shrine, And tunes her lyre to harmony divine; Shall I attempt to join the favour'd throng, And pay the tribute of an artless song? Bright as the beams of glory round you shine, Glance not contempt, ye minions of the nine; Bold as I soar, yet never think I came, A rival Muse, to grasp the wreath of fame; Though oft a wand'rer through the lone retreats Of your Parnassus, stor'd with balmy sweets; Where flow'rs and blossoms, of the lovliest hue, In lively bloom and vary'd fragrance grew; Their winning beauties gave but short delight, Borne by superior genius from my sight; 2 Yet may my humble blossom find a place Amidst the wreath each bard has twin'd to grace The brow of sympathy, for, oft there grows, On the same spot, the daisy and the rose. Nor may the rose disdain the modest flow'r That gives her beauties more distinguish'd pow'r. What though no hand, in honour of my lay, Shall bind my temples with Parnassian bay; Or fancy raise no bright poetic dream; Yet soft humanity inspires my theme. All bounteous heav'n, that bless'd my native isle With gentle Liberty's enchanting smile, Gave me a heart, too oft indeed to blame, Yet fraught with feelings none should blush to name. Long in that heart may mild compassion reign, Compassion, form'd to weep for others pain; The throb of anguish ever swell my breast, When mis'ry sinks, by tyranny oppress'd. May one dire fiend far from my wishes stray, No baneful av'rice e'er my actions sway; 3 That vile assassin, stain'd with num'rous crimes, Who bears the shaft of death to distant climes; Whose flinty breast, unknown to social love, No tears, no pray'rs, no suff'rings, e'er can move. When he appears, behold affection bleed! Joy flies the scene and lasting pangs succeed. And shall Britannia, whose maternal arms Clasp every virtue, dress'd in heavenly charms; Shall she, when rival realms revere her name, She, pride of nations and the boast of fame, Welcome a guest so vile, and seek to gain New treasures from the guiltless suff'rer's pain? When justice, fir'd by distant scenes explor'd, High o'er the foes of Asia waves her sword? To wounded Africa's unhappy shore, No pow'r the violated rights restore? Sad on her plains the plunder'd wretches bend, To weep a child, a parent, or a friend; For, all that Britons feel, their souls inspire, The same affection and the same desire; 4 The mournful dame, with equal frenzy, wild, Laments the hapless fortune of her child, Torn from her arms, snatch'd from his native soil, To sad captivity and painful toil! In vain she weeps, in vain she swells to rage, The wretch still suffers what her fears presage. These scenes of woe, ye son's of av'rice, view, These sorrows fill the cup of mirth for you; Ah! think, for you, what blessings nature pours, Fames courts your grasp, and fortune swells your stores; Whilst art and luxury their charms employ To dress your hours in fascinating joy; While round your steps seducing syrens sing, Ah! think, whence do these fatal pleasures spring! Survey the wretch whose toil creates your joy, No chearful hopes his gloomy mind employ; If he reflects what hours in sadness flew, The next as sadly opens to his view; Each sun, that rises, rises but to shed Fresh streams of sorrow on his hapless head; 5 In vain o'er him revolving seasons roll, They bring no peace to his aflicted soul! Say, does the gallant soldier waste his breath Amid the horrors of triumphant death? Deep pierc'd with wounds, does he the martial band Inspire with ardour for their native land? Fearless of perils, that around him wait, He braves the dangers of impending fate; Yet honours to reward his toil appear, And loud applause salutes his raptur'd ear; Millions to him their grateful thanks avow, And conquest twines her laurel round his brow. Not thus the slave; alas! no honours bloom To soothe the constant rigour of his doom; Ambition unrestrain'd that noble flame That guides the hero to the heights of fame, The sole inspirer and the glorious spring Of all that record boasts, or poets sing; Ambition, ever anxious to aspire, Burns in his breast a fierce, but hopeless, fire; 6 With fainting heart he sees the morning smile, And goes, reluctant, to his wonted toil; His weaken'd spirits still invite repose, And gloomy apathy his mind o'erflows. Ye foes of heav'n, and Britain's dire disgrace, Unjust opressors of an injur'd race, Tell us, who form'd the slave you thus deride, The sport of insult, indolence, and pride? With mis'ry should he sink so meanly down, Adore your smile, and tremble when you frown; At your command with servile swiftness fly, And mark with dread the language of your eye? Tell, why such baleful tyranny should reign, Caprice empow'ring to distribute pain? Yet, you will say, surrounding foes combine To catch th'advantages that we decline; But, sure, that impious land must deeply bleed, And dark dishonour all its fame succeed; Then let them hence the guilty commerce bear, And what heav'n sanctions be Britannia's care. 7 Once Superstition, in a fatal hour, O'er Europe rais'd the sceptre of her power; She reign'd triumphant minister of death, And peace and pleasure faded in her breath; Deep in monastic solitude entomb'd, The bud of beauty wither'd ere it bloom'd; The brilliant eye, where love had fought to dwell, Shed all its lustre o'er the cloister'd cell; The smiling lip, of bright vermillion dye, Grew pale, and quiver'd with the passing sigh; The music floating from each tuneful tongue, With midnight hymns the Gothic arches rung. Here, through reflection's eye, the pensive mind Sought with regret for objects far behind; And fond remembrance, as she heav'd a sigh, Drew back the soul just soaring to the sky; Save where misguided zeal in peace withdrew, From each bright pleasure, each enchanting view. The still retreat pale Melancholy sought, And found each object suited to her thought; 8 Soft Sensibility might here deplore, And feel the shaft of falsehood wound no more; The sport of fortune, long to comfort lost, With hope far banish'd, expectation cross'd; Explor'd these scenes to weep for anguish past, Where the swell'd throbbing heart has burst at last. Th'Eternal from the throne of grace survey'd, With eye averse, the sacrifice they made; No forc'd devotion found acceptance there, No grateful incense issu'd from her pray'r. Thus Superstition could not fix her sway In heav'n, but look'd on earth to seize her prey; And yet, unsated with domestic pain, Sought to extend the terrors of her reign. She saw, as on the fatal heights she stood, Her impious altars drench'd in guiltless blood; Where fortitude with candid virtue join'd, And sought by sacred truths to save mankind; There she bestow'd her persecutions dire, And close pursu'd with unrelenting ire; 9 Nor ceas'd to scourge them with her vengeful rod, Till each, a martyr'd saint, embrac'd his God. But when, to grace the world, Religion shone, In Britain first she deign'd to fix her throne; Freedom and Charity, at her command, Chas'd Superstition from the drooping land; Despair, as public discourd ceas'd to sting, Beat the retiring gloom with raven wing; In vain Enthusiasm disdain'd to fly, And roll'd the livid light'ning of her eye; In vain with phrenzy wild her fetters broke, And threaten'd horrid vengeance as she spoke; Religion bound her with her magic chain, And fix'd a period to the monster's reign; Yet, last of all, withdrew a blacker foe Than ever issu'd from the realms below; Fraudful Hypocrisy, in whom was seen An aspect ever gentle and serene; Her tongue was fraught with many an artful lie, Dissembled sanctity illum'd her eye; 10 She wore the spotless robe of heav'nly truth, To cheat credulity and artless youth; Soft on her smiling lip dire falsehood hung, And music grac'd the poison of her tongue. But soon the fell contention rag'd no more, And liberty the victors garland wore: Yet, as the conquering goddess soar'd to life, She mourn'd the ravage of internal strife. So when some furious tempest racks the night, To break her solemn gloom with horrid light, Morn smiles to show the blasted plants and flow'rs, Or torn trees mingling with the shatter'd tow'rs. Thus, from the wreck of civil broils, arose The dread and envy of insulting foes; Thus rose the honours of Britannia's name; Her naval splendour and her martial fame. There hoary time on rapid wing might view Immortal glories ripen as he flew; The gems of genius there adorn the mind, By science polish'd, and by taste refin'd; 11 There in the beams of liberty alone, Appears the soften'd splendour of a throne. Nor could my Muse, did she to rapture spring, The bright succession of those glories sing. In other lands if public virtue glows, From Britain first the great example flows; There springs the plant, there blooms, through endless time, The weak exotic of another clime; The Britons' gen'rous valour never fought To gain a conquest with oppressions fraught; They own the spirit to be tryly brave, The pow'r to conquer and the will to save; They boast the sympathy to soften woe, To form the faithful friend and gen'rous foe. View from that happy shore a nymph arise, Bright as the blushes of autumnal skies; She comes, angelic Freedom, with her train, To tear from Afric's sons the galling chain; 12 See at her feet each generous Briton kneels, Each views your inj'ries and your anguish feels; Neglect long shewn, your suff'rings seeks to blame, And, seeking, blushes for his country's fame. Amidst the glories of an age refin'd, The feeling heart, the sympathising mind, With fond attention o'er your sorrows pause, And join with ardour in the glorious cause. Friends of philanthropy, to you be giv'n The greatest bounties of indulgent heav'n; Peace o'er your slumbers ever stretch her wing, And 'neath your feet eternal blessings spring; For, angels teach celestial joys to flow On hearts where sympathy delights to glow; That peace divine, that can the soul sustain, When keen affliction aims the shaft of pain, That Pow'r from life's dark danger form'd to save, And lift the eye of hope beyond the grave. Goddess of Freedom, hear thy suppliant's pray'r, And haste to snatch the captive from despair; 13 Before his lighten'd steps thy pleasures strew, And place thy train of virtues in his view; Bid his unfetter'd inclination stray, Where blooming industry extends her sway; Where indolence herself was oft beguil'd, By promis'd gain, to tread the rugged wild; Rouse ev'ry passion, wake each fond desire, And teach his wishes greatly to aspire; Instruct him, goddess, on his native plain, To sing the glories of a George's reign; Tell him, at his command you sought their shore, Their wrongs to pity, and their rights restore; Through the blue concave thy white flag unfurl'd, And arm thy bands to prop a sinking world. 14 SLAVERY. A POEM. BY HARRIET FALCONAR. YE noble few, firm fix'd in virtue's cause, Ye just protectors of our sacred laws, Whose hearts stern av'rice strove in vain to steel, And bless'd with souls disdaining not to feel; Let not the genial warmth, the latent fire, That glows in Britain's valiant sons, expire; But in your breasts let justice still prevail, While Pity weeps to hear the woe-fraught tale. Angelic maid, thy melting eye may boast The tear still pour'd o'er Afric's desert coast; Unhappy land, where hostile av'rice reigns, And rears her blood-stain'd banners o'er thy plains; Where stern Opression's hireling minions rove, To burst each tender tie of social love; Inhuman fiend, thy desolating hand Spread wide destruction o'er the bleeding land; 15 Bade gay-plum'd joy and guiltless pleasure cease, And banish'd far the healing balm of peace. Yet once on them fair Peace propitious smil'd, And social joy the tedious hour beguil'd; On them bright Pleasure cast her fairest ray, Soft as the rosy beam of op'ning day; Love, health, and innocence, they still possess'd, Contested tenants of the peaceful breast; Vindictive fate rul'd o'er thye dreadful hour, When first Opression's desolating pow'r, Deaf to the mourning parents plaintive cry, The widow's fondness or the lover's sigh, From each fond breast the hapless victims tore, Far from the prospect of their native shore. Think not, ye slaves in pleasure's venal train, The weeping orphan's tears are pour'd in vain; Awhile in soft repose ye calmly rest, Nor heed the pangs that tear each bleeding breast; For you gay Pleasure spreads her gladsome wing, And fair the fading flow'rs of fortune spring; 16 Yet heav'n, indignant, views the impious deed That bids the injur'd sons of Afric bleed; Soon shall the voice of angry Justice call, And bid the pointed sword of vengeance fall; Shall pleasure then avert the dreadful nod, Or calm the vengeance of an angry God? No, in that hour reflection wakes anew, And calls each crime, each folly, to the view; Bids the lost thoughts eternity explore, Or pause o'er scenes we can recal no more. To man superior reason's light was giv'n, Reason, the noblest gift of bounteous heav'n; Unfailing beam, bright intellectual ray Thou steady guide through errors devious way; Say, wert thou first by gracious heav'n design'd, To stamp injustice on the human kind; Forbid it truth, forbid it ev'ry breast That heaves in pity for the wretch oppress'd; Yet reason, jutice, mercy, plead in vain, Still the sad victim drags his galling chain; 17 Still bows submissive to the tyrant hand, That tore the suff'rer from his native land; Yet, e'er the arts of lux'ry began, They boasted liberty, the right of man; Serene, they saw each peaceful morning smile, Joy led their hours and plenty bless'd their toil; Their pleading sighs, their suppliant moving pray'r, Daughter of Virtue! Royal Charlotte, hear! Sovereign, yet parent, of this happy isle, O'er whose gay plains fair Plenty deigns to smile; Where spotless peace extends her azure wing, And liberty's enchanting blossoms spring; Thine is compassion's sympathetic sigh, The melting tear that beams in pity's eye; The heart like thine, that feels another's pain, Hears not distress'd misfortune plead in vain; Be't thine to heal pale sorrow's wounded breast, And lull each raging passion into rest; Let not the wretched slave in vain deplore The long-lost joys he must behold no more; 18 Then, while Britannia hails thy sacred name, A deed like this shall swell the trump of fame; Virtues like thine shall wake the sounding lyre, Each bosom glow with emulative fire; And, swell'd with themes like this, the poet's page Remain admir'd through each succeeding age. When Superstition rais'd her threat'ning hand, And scatter's horror round the bleeding land, On sad Britannia's ravag'd plains she stood, Drench'd in one fatal stream of martyr'd blood; O'er ev'ry scene, with fell delight, she flew, And smil'd, exulting, at the dreadful view; Religion's sacred truths, though once design'd To banish error from the darken'd mind, Avail'd not here; her pure celestial light, Lost in the gloom of superstition's night, Drooping, beheld the fatal torrent roll Resistless terrors o'er the doubtful soul; Till bright Eliza came, whose matchless sway Call'd forth the dawn of fair religion's day; 19 Cherish'd the genial influence as it rose, Dispell'd their errors and reliev'd their woes. Shall Britain then, who boasts th'unrivall'd deed, Relentless, see the guiltless victim bleed; Amid the horrors of tormenting pain He seeks for mercy, but he seeks in vain; Affrighted Mercy quits the guilty land, Where grim Oppression waves her tyrant hand; Where, to the savage herd, a harmless prey, Sinks faint beneath the fervid beam of day; Or, haply trembling in the midnight air, Sunk in the deepest gloom of low despair; Or burning thirst and furious want, combin'd, With wild distraction fire his glowing mind, Till death restores to him eternal rest, And calms the tumults of his troubled breast. The British youth, torn from his much-lov'd home, O'er foreign seas and foreign coasts to roam, Amid the fury of the piercing blast, The swell'd wave circling round the shiver'd mast, 20 While bursting peals of thunder rend the skies, And o'er the deck the foaming billows rise, Awhile in terror views the light'ning glare, With streaming horror, through the midnight air; The storm once past, he gains the friendly ray Of hope, to guide him through the dang'rous way; Smiling, she bids each future prospect rise, Through fancy's vary'd mirror, to his eyes. Not so the slave; oppress'd with secret care, He sinks the hapless victim of despair; Or, doom'd to torments that might even move The steely heart, and melt it into love; Til worn with anguish, with'ring in his bloom, He falls an early tenant of the tomb! Shall Britain view, unmov'd, sad Afric's shore Delug'd so oft in streams of purple gore! Britain, where science, peace, and plenty, smile, Virtue's bright seat, and freedom's favour'd isle! Rich are her plains and fruitful is her clime, The scourge of tyrants, and the boast of time; 21 Of ev'ry virtue, ev'ry worth possess'd That fires the hero's or the patriot's breast; There, nobly warm'd with animating fire, Our Shakespear struck his soul-commanding lyre; There scenes of bliss immortal Milton sung, And notes harmonious issu'd from his tongue; And bards like these shall boast in ev'ry age, While native genius glows in Hayley's page; While genius bids, to our enchanted eyes, In Swift's own strains, a second Pope arise. When truth, perplex'd in error's thorny maze, Threw o'er the world obscure and darken'd rays, then Newton rose, unveil'd the beauteous maid; He spoke, and nature stood at once display'd. These were the souls that Britain once posses'd, When genuine virtue fir'd the patriot's breast; And still shall she protect fair freedom's cause, And vindicate her violated laws; Waft peace and freedom to a wretched land, And scatter blessings with a lib'ral hand. 22 In Britain's paradise, by freedom made, The tree of commerce spread's its ample shade; Unsparing plenty bends the lofty brow, And wealth bright glitters on each golden bough; On some the richest gems of India shone, And added lustre to the British throne; Such as in gentle radiance might outvie The melting lustre of the sparkling eye; Such as in gay variety might grace The native beauties of the lovely face: On some the bud of health, in rosy bloom, Call'd languid sickness from an early tomb; Or bade contented labour calmly smile O'er the rich prospect of his native soil. One ample branch, superior to the rest, Rose to the view, in splendid radiance dress'd; On ev'ry leaf the tempting manna hung, In golden dyes each beauteous blossom sprung; The flow'rs of brightest hue oppression nam'd, Yet from the tree the rank of commerce claim'd; 23 Led by the fair deciet beneath its shade, With eager eye the slaves of av'rice stray'd; This fatal fruit was lovliest to the view, That on the spreading tree of commerce grew; They grasp'd the baneful load with fatal haste, Destructive poison to the th'enchanted taste; Lost in the pleasing dream, awhile the soul, Where av'rice reign'd secure from all controul, Slept calm, till conscience, with unerring dart, Struck deep conviction through the guilty heart; And bade reflection wake the feeling mind, That turn'd to ev'ry scene it left behind: There might they see the tortur'd wretch implore Eternal vengeance on Britannia's shore; In silent grief, amid distraction wild, The wretched parent mourn her long-lost child; These scenes appear when death, in terror dress'd, Bids sharp repentance wound the shudd'ring breast; When o'er your heads th'avenging thunders roll, And quick destruction seems to snatch the soul; 24 When fast around the dreadful light'nings fall, And guilt shall hear th'incens'd Almighty's call; Then will his wrath destroy the life he gave, And justice snatch the soul that mercy could not save. Britain, be thine the glorious task to heal The bleeding wounds thy wretched sons shall feel; Extend thy ev'ry noble pow'r to save The wretch just tott'ring o'er an early grave; For, noble were the deed that could impart Reviving vigour to the drooping heart; For, then no more the fatal branch shall bind, In golden ties, the lost enchanted mind; Tear ev'ry fibre from the verdant root, And blast each dang'rous blossom ere it shoot; So shall the praise of ransom'd millions rise, In grateful incense, to the echoing skies; So through the world thy matchless fame extend, And wond'ring nations hail thee mercy's friend; Thee, first in ev'ry virtue, ev'ry worth, That gives to glory or to genius birth; 25 Let thy avenging, thy all-conqu'ring, hand Give peace and freedom to an injur'd land! Glory be thine; and, let pale mis'ry prove The joys of friendship and the bliss of love; And heav'nly liberty's celestial ray Beam o'er the world one pure eternal day!

MADAM, Honoured with the protection of your Grace, we have ventured to present the following little pieces to the public, confident that your approbation is sufficient to recommend them. Of your impar- vi DEDICATION. tial generosity we have recieved a most indisputable proof, by this favour you have condescended to confer upon us, who were personally strangers to your Grace, and whose sole recommendation was an attachment to the muses. This circumstance alone will afford ample testimony of your regard to the interests of literature, while the attention you have paid to the subject of these poems reflects the truest honour on your sensibility. However, therefore, the faults of this DEDICATION. vii publication may be thought worthy of censure, we have the satisfaction to know that is possesses one merit, as our taste will certainly be commended in the choice of a patron so illustrious. We have the Honour to be, With the profoundest Respect, Your Grace's most obliged, And most humble Servants, M. and H.FALCONAR. ( 1 ) SLAVERY. A POEM. BY MARIA FALCONAR. HAIL, soft Philanthropy, to thee I sing Blest source, whence all our social pleasures spring; When every Muse bends prostrate at thy shrine, And tunes her lyre to harmony divine; Shall I attempt to join the favour'd throng, And pay the tribute of an artless song? Bright as the beams of glory round you shine, Glance not contempt, ye minions of the nine; Bold as I soar, yet never think I came, A rival Muse, to grasp the wreath of fame; Though oft a wand'rer through the lone retreats Of your Parnassus, stor'd with balmy sweets; Where flow'rs and blossoms, of the lovliest hue, In lively bloom and vary'd fragrance grew; Their winning beauties gave but short delight, Borne by superior genius from my sight; 2 Yet may my humble blossom find a place Amidst the wreath each bard has twin'd to grace The brow of sympathy, for, oft there grows, On the same spot, the daisy and the rose. Nor may the rose disdain the modest flow'r That gives her beauties more distinguish'd pow'r. What though no hand, in honour of my lay, Shall bind my temples with Parnassian bay; Or fancy raise no bright poetic dream; Yet soft humanity inspires my theme. All bounteous heav'n, that bless'd my native isle With gentle Liberty's enchanting smile, Gave me a heart, too oft indeed to blame, Yet fraught with feelings none should blush to name. Long in that heart may mild compassion reign, Compassion, form'd to weep for others pain; The throb of anguish ever swell my breast, When mis'ry sinks, by tyranny oppress'd. May one dire fiend far from my wishes stray, No baneful av'rice e'er my actions sway; 3 That vile assassin, stain'd with num'rous crimes, Who bears the shaft of death to distant climes; Whose flinty breast, unknown to social love, No tears, no pray'rs, no suff'rings, e'er can move. When he appears, behold affection bleed! Joy flies the scene and lasting pangs succeed. And shall Britannia, whose maternal arms Clasp every virtue, dress'd in heavenly charms; Shall she, when rival realms revere her name, She, pride of nations and the boast of fame, Welcome a guest so vile, and seek to gain New treasures from the guiltless suff'rer's pain? When justice, fir'd by distant scenes explor'd, High o'er the foes of Asia waves her sword? To wounded Africa's unhappy shore, No pow'r the violated rights restore? Sad on her plains the plunder'd wretches bend, To weep a child, a parent, or a friend; For, all that Britons feel, their souls inspire, The same affection and the same desire; 4 The mournful dame, with equal frenzy, wild, Laments the hapless fortune of her child, Torn from her arms, snatch'd from his native soil, To sad captivity and painful toil! In vain she weeps, in vain she swells to rage, The wretch still suffers what her fears presage. These scenes of woe, ye son's of av'rice, view, These sorrows fill the cup of mirth for you; Ah! think, for you, what blessings nature pours, Fames courts your grasp, and fortune swells your stores; Whilst art and luxury their charms employ To dress your hours in fascinating joy; While round your steps seducing syrens sing, Ah! think, whence do these fatal pleasures spring! Survey the wretch whose toil creates your joy, No chearful hopes his gloomy mind employ; If he reflects what hours in sadness flew, The next as sadly opens to his view; Each sun, that rises, rises but to shed Fresh streams of sorrow on his hapless head; 5 In vain o'er him revolving seasons roll, They bring no peace to his aflicted soul! Say, does the gallant soldier waste his breath Amid the horrors of triumphant death? Deep pierc'd with wounds, does he the martial band Inspire with ardour for their native land? Fearless of perils, that around him wait, He braves the dangers of impending fate; Yet honours to reward his toil appear, And loud applause salutes his raptur'd ear; Millions to him their grateful thanks avow, And conquest twines her laurel round his brow. Not thus the slave; alas! no honours bloom To soothe the constant rigour of his doom; Ambition unrestrain'd that noble flame That guides the hero to the heights of fame, The sole inspirer and the glorious spring Of all that record boasts, or poets sing; Ambition, ever anxious to aspire, Burns in his breast a fierce, but hopeless, fire; 6 With fainting heart he sees the morning smile, And goes, reluctant, to his wonted toil; His weaken'd spirits still invite repose, And gloomy apathy his mind o'erflows. Ye foes of heav'n, and Britain's dire disgrace, Unjust opressors of an injur'd race, Tell us, who form'd the slave you thus deride, The sport of insult, indolence, and pride? With mis'ry should he sink so meanly down, Adore your smile, and tremble when you frown; At your command with servile swiftness fly, And mark with dread the language of your eye? Tell, why such baleful tyranny should reign, Caprice empow'ring to distribute pain? Yet, you will say, surrounding foes combine To catch th'advantages that we decline; But, sure, that impious land must deeply bleed, And dark dishonour all its fame succeed; Then let them hence the guilty commerce bear, And what heav'n sanctions be Britannia's care. 7 Once Superstition, in a fatal hour, O'er Europe rais'd the sceptre of her power; She reign'd triumphant minister of death, And peace and pleasure faded in her breath; Deep in monastic solitude entomb'd, The bud of beauty wither'd ere it bloom'd; The brilliant eye, where love had fought to dwell, Shed all its lustre o'er the cloister'd cell; The smiling lip, of bright vermillion dye, Grew pale, and quiver'd with the passing sigh; The music floating from each tuneful tongue, With midnight hymns the Gothic arches rung. Here, through reflection's eye, the pensive mind Sought with regret for objects far behind; And fond remembrance, as she heav'd a sigh, Drew back the soul just soaring to the sky; Save where misguided zeal in peace withdrew, From each bright pleasure, each enchanting view. The still retreat pale Melancholy sought, And found each object suited to her thought; 8 Soft Sensibility might here deplore, And feel the shaft of falsehood wound no more; The sport of fortune, long to comfort lost, With hope far banish'd, expectation cross'd; Explor'd these scenes to weep for anguish past, Where the swell'd throbbing heart has burst at last. Th'Eternal from the throne of grace survey'd, With eye averse, the sacrifice they made; No forc'd devotion found acceptance there, No grateful incense issu'd from her pray'r. Thus Superstition could not fix her sway In heav'n, but look'd on earth to seize her prey; And yet, unsated with domestic pain, Sought to extend the terrors of her reign. She saw, as on the fatal heights she stood, Her impious altars drench'd in guiltless blood; Where fortitude with candid virtue join'd, And sought by sacred truths to save mankind; There she bestow'd her persecutions dire, And close pursu'd with unrelenting ire; 9 Nor ceas'd to scourge them with her vengeful rod, Till each, a martyr'd saint, embrac'd his God. But when, to grace the world, Religion shone, In Britain first she deign'd to fix her throne; Freedom and Charity, at her command, Chas'd Superstition from the drooping land; Despair, as public discourd ceas'd to sting, Beat the retiring gloom with raven wing; In vain Enthusiasm disdain'd to fly, And roll'd the livid light'ning of her eye; In vain with phrenzy wild her fetters broke, And threaten'd horrid vengeance as she spoke; Religion bound her with her magic chain, And fix'd a period to the monster's reign; Yet, last of all, withdrew a blacker foe Than ever issu'd from the realms below; Fraudful Hypocrisy, in whom was seen An aspect ever gentle and serene; Her tongue was fraught with many an artful lie, Dissembled sanctity illum'd her eye; 10 She wore the spotless robe of heav'nly truth, To cheat credulity and artless youth; Soft on her smiling lip dire falsehood hung, And music grac'd the poison of her tongue. But soon the fell contention rag'd no more, And liberty the victors garland wore: Yet, as the conquering goddess soar'd to life, She mourn'd the ravage of internal strife. So when some furious tempest racks the night, To break her solemn gloom with horrid light, Morn smiles to show the blasted plants and flow'rs, Or torn trees mingling with the shatter'd tow'rs. Thus, from the wreck of civil broils, arose The dread and envy of insulting foes; Thus rose the honours of Britannia's name; Her naval splendour and her martial fame. There hoary time on rapid wing might view Immortal glories ripen as he flew; The gems of genius there adorn the mind, By science polish'd, and by taste refin'd; 11 There in the beams of liberty alone, Appears the soften'd splendour of a throne. Nor could my Muse, did she to rapture spring, The bright succession of those glories sing. In other lands if public virtue glows, From Britain first the great example flows; There springs the plant, there blooms, through endless time, The weak exotic of another clime; The Britons' gen'rous valour never fought To gain a conquest with oppressions fraught; They own the spirit to be tryly brave, The pow'r to conquer and the will to save; They boast the sympathy to soften woe, To form the faithful friend and gen'rous foe. View from that happy shore a nymph arise, Bright as the blushes of autumnal skies; She comes, angelic Freedom, with her train, To tear from Afric's sons the galling chain; 12 See at her feet each generous Briton kneels, Each views your inj'ries and your anguish feels; Neglect long shewn, your suff'rings seeks to blame, And, seeking, blushes for his country's fame. Amidst the glories of an age refin'd, The feeling heart, the sympathising mind, With fond attention o'er your sorrows pause, And join with ardour in the glorious cause. Friends of philanthropy, to you be giv'n The greatest bounties of indulgent heav'n; Peace o'er your slumbers ever stretch her wing, And 'neath your feet eternal blessings spring; For, angels teach celestial joys to flow On hearts where sympathy delights to glow; That peace divine, that can the soul sustain, When keen affliction aims the shaft of pain, That Pow'r from life's dark danger form'd to save, And lift the eye of hope beyond the grave. Goddess of Freedom, hear thy suppliant's pray'r, And haste to snatch the captive from despair; 13 Before his lighten'd steps thy pleasures strew, And place thy train of virtues in his view; Bid his unfetter'd inclination stray, Where blooming industry extends her sway; Where indolence herself was oft beguil'd, By promis'd gain, to tread the rugged wild; Rouse ev'ry passion, wake each fond desire, And teach his wishes greatly to aspire; Instruct him, goddess, on his native plain, To sing the glories of a George's reign; Tell him, at his command you sought their shore, Their wrongs to pity, and their rights restore; Through the blue concave thy white flag unfurl'd, And arm thy bands to prop a sinking world. 14 SLAVERY. A POEM. BY HARRIET FALCONAR. YE noble few, firm fix'd in virtue's cause, Ye just protectors of our sacred laws, Whose hearts stern av'rice strove in vain to steel, And bless'd with souls disdaining not to feel; Let not the genial warmth, the latent fire, That glows in Britain's valiant sons, expire; But in your breasts let justice still prevail, While Pity weeps to hear the woe-fraught tale. Angelic maid, thy melting eye may boast The tear still pour'd o'er Afric's desert coast; Unhappy land, where hostile av'rice reigns, And rears her blood-stain'd banners o'er thy plains; Where stern Opression's hireling minions rove, To burst each tender tie of social love; Inhuman fiend, thy desolating hand Spread wide destruction o'er the bleeding land; 15 Bade gay-plum'd joy and guiltless pleasure cease, And banish'd far the healing balm of peace. Yet once on them fair Peace propitious smil'd, And social joy the tedious hour beguil'd; On them bright Pleasure cast her fairest ray, Soft as the rosy beam of op'ning day; Love, health, and innocence, they still possess'd, Contested tenants of the peaceful breast; Vindictive fate rul'd o'er thye dreadful hour, When first Opression's desolating pow'r, Deaf to the mourning parents plaintive cry, The widow's fondness or the lover's sigh, From each fond breast the hapless victims tore, Far from the prospect of their native shore. Think not, ye slaves in pleasure's venal train, The weeping orphan's tears are pour'd in vain; Awhile in soft repose ye calmly rest, Nor heed the pangs that tear each bleeding breast; For you gay Pleasure spreads her gladsome wing, And fair the fading flow'rs of fortune spring; 16 Yet heav'n, indignant, views the impious deed That bids the injur'd sons of Afric bleed; Soon shall the voice of angry Justice call, And bid the pointed sword of vengeance fall; Shall pleasure then avert the dreadful nod, Or calm the vengeance of an angry God? No, in that hour reflection wakes anew, And calls each crime, each folly, to the view; Bids the lost thoughts eternity explore, Or pause o'er scenes we can recal no more. To man superior reason's light was giv'n, Reason, the noblest gift of bounteous heav'n; Unfailing beam, bright intellectual ray Thou steady guide through errors devious way; Say, wert thou first by gracious heav'n design'd, To stamp injustice on the human kind; Forbid it truth, forbid it ev'ry breast That heaves in pity for the wretch oppress'd; Yet reason, jutice, mercy, plead in vain, Still the sad victim drags his galling chain; 17 Still bows submissive to the tyrant hand, That tore the suff'rer from his native land; Yet, e'er the arts of lux'ry began, They boasted liberty, the right of man; Serene, they saw each peaceful morning smile, Joy led their hours and plenty bless'd their toil; Their pleading sighs, their suppliant moving pray'r, Daughter of Virtue! Royal Charlotte, hear! Sovereign, yet parent, of this happy isle, O'er whose gay plains fair Plenty deigns to smile; Where spotless peace extends her azure wing, And liberty's enchanting blossoms spring; Thine is compassion's sympathetic sigh, The melting tear that beams in pity's eye; The heart like thine, that feels another's pain, Hears not distress'd misfortune plead in vain; Be't thine to heal pale sorrow's wounded breast, And lull each raging passion into rest; Let not the wretched slave in vain deplore The long-lost joys he must behold no more; 18 Then, while Britannia hails thy sacred name, A deed like this shall swell the trump of fame; Virtues like thine shall wake the sounding lyre, Each bosom glow with emulative fire; And, swell'd with themes like this, the poet's page Remain admir'd through each succeeding age. When Superstition rais'd her threat'ning hand, And scatter's horror round the bleeding land, On sad Britannia's ravag'd plains she stood, Drench'd in one fatal stream of martyr'd blood; O'er ev'ry scene, with fell delight, she flew, And smil'd, exulting, at the dreadful view; Religion's sacred truths, though once design'd To banish error from the darken'd mind, Avail'd not here; her pure celestial light, Lost in the gloom of superstition's night, Drooping, beheld the fatal torrent roll Resistless terrors o'er the doubtful soul; Till bright Eliza came, whose matchless sway Call'd forth the dawn of fair religion's day; 19 Cherish'd the genial influence as it rose, Dispell'd their errors and reliev'd their woes. Shall Britain then, who boasts th'unrivall'd deed, Relentless, see the guiltless victim bleed; Amid the horrors of tormenting pain He seeks for mercy, but he seeks in vain; Affrighted Mercy quits the guilty land, Where grim Oppression waves her tyrant hand; Where, to the savage herd, a harmless prey, Sinks faint beneath the fervid beam of day; Or, haply trembling in the midnight air, Sunk in the deepest gloom of low despair; Or burning thirst and furious want, combin'd, With wild distraction fire his glowing mind, Till death restores to him eternal rest, And calms the tumults of his troubled breast. The British youth, torn from his much-lov'd home, O'er foreign seas and foreign coasts to roam, Amid the fury of the piercing blast, The swell'd wave circling round the shiver'd mast, 20 While bursting peals of thunder rend the skies, And o'er the deck the foaming billows rise, Awhile in terror views the light'ning glare, With streaming horror, through the midnight air; The storm once past, he gains the friendly ray Of hope, to guide him through the dang'rous way; Smiling, she bids each future prospect rise, Through fancy's vary'd mirror, to his eyes. Not so the slave; oppress'd with secret care, He sinks the hapless victim of despair; Or, doom'd to torments that might even move The steely heart, and melt it into love; Til worn with anguish, with'ring in his bloom, He falls an early tenant of the tomb! Shall Britain view, unmov'd, sad Afric's shore Delug'd so oft in streams of purple gore! Britain, where science, peace, and plenty, smile, Virtue's bright seat, and freedom's favour'd isle! Rich are her plains and fruitful is her clime, The scourge of tyrants, and the boast of time; 21 Of ev'ry virtue, ev'ry worth possess'd That fires the hero's or the patriot's breast; There, nobly warm'd with animating fire, Our Shakespear struck his soul-commanding lyre; There scenes of bliss immortal Milton sung, And notes harmonious issu'd from his tongue; And bards like these shall boast in ev'ry age, While native genius glows in Hayley's page; While genius bids, to our enchanted eyes, In Swift's own strains, a second Pope arise. When truth, perplex'd in error's thorny maze, Threw o'er the world obscure and darken'd rays, then Newton rose, unveil'd the beauteous maid; He spoke, and nature stood at once display'd. These were the souls that Britain once posses'd, When genuine virtue fir'd the patriot's breast; And still shall she protect fair freedom's cause, And vindicate her violated laws; Waft peace and freedom to a wretched land, And scatter blessings with a lib'ral hand. 22 In Britain's paradise, by freedom made, The tree of commerce spread's its ample shade; Unsparing plenty bends the lofty brow, And wealth bright glitters on each golden bough; On some the richest gems of India shone, And added lustre to the British throne; Such as in gentle radiance might outvie The melting lustre of the sparkling eye; Such as in gay variety might grace The native beauties of the lovely face: On some the bud of health, in rosy bloom, Call'd languid sickness from an early tomb; Or bade contented labour calmly smile O'er the rich prospect of his native soil. One ample branch, superior to the rest, Rose to the view, in splendid radiance dress'd; On ev'ry leaf the tempting manna hung, In golden dyes each beauteous blossom sprung; The flow'rs of brightest hue oppression nam'd, Yet from the tree the rank of commerce claim'd; 23 Led by the fair deciet beneath its shade, With eager eye the slaves of av'rice stray'd; This fatal fruit was lovliest to the view, That on the spreading tree of commerce grew; They grasp'd the baneful load with fatal haste, Destructive poison to the th'enchanted taste; Lost in the pleasing dream, awhile the soul, Where av'rice reign'd secure from all controul, Slept calm, till conscience, with unerring dart, Struck deep conviction through the guilty heart; And bade reflection wake the feeling mind, That turn'd to ev'ry scene it left behind: There might they see the tortur'd wretch implore Eternal vengeance on Britannia's shore; In silent grief, amid distraction wild, The wretched parent mourn her long-lost child; These scenes appear when death, in terror dress'd, Bids sharp repentance wound the shudd'ring breast; When o'er your heads th'avenging thunders roll, And quick destruction seems to snatch the soul; 24 When fast around the dreadful light'nings fall, And guilt shall hear th'incens'd Almighty's call; Then will his wrath destroy the life he gave, And justice snatch the soul that mercy could not save. Britain, be thine the glorious task to heal The bleeding wounds thy wretched sons shall feel; Extend thy ev'ry noble pow'r to save The wretch just tott'ring o'er an early grave; For, noble were the deed that could impart Reviving vigour to the drooping heart; For, then no more the fatal branch shall bind, In golden ties, the lost enchanted mind; Tear ev'ry fibre from the verdant root, And blast each dang'rous blossom ere it shoot; So shall the praise of ransom'd millions rise, In grateful incense, to the echoing skies; So through the world thy matchless fame extend, And wond'ring nations hail thee mercy's friend; Thee, first in ev'ry virtue, ev'ry worth, That gives to glory or to genius birth; 25 Let thy avenging, thy all-conqu'ring, hand Give peace and freedom to an injur'd land! Glory be thine; and, let pale mis'ry prove The joys of friendship and the bliss of love; And heav'nly liberty's celestial ray Beam o'er the world one pure eternal day!

6,Card_1792_2.txt,"A POEM ON THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE. ADDRESSED TO HER OWN SEX, BY M. BIRKETT. PART II. ""DISGUISE THYSELF AS THOU WILT, STILL, SLAVERY, STILL THOU ""ART A BITTER CUP."" STERNE. DUBLIN: PRINTED BY J. JONES, NO. 111, GRAFTON-STREET. MDCCXCII. PREFACE ENCOURAGED by the kind and un- merited Partiality with which the first Part of this little Attempt has been received, I again present to public Observation the spontaneous Effusions of an unpolished Fancy. I fear I may justly incur the Censure of having acted with unbecoming Warmth, though on such an impor- tant, interesting, and inexhaustible Theme. â€“ Compassion for those unhappy Beings, whose Cause I urge,—my own inexperience,—and the Feel- ings of every humane Heart, to which I appeal, must be my Advocates. A POEM ON THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE. ERST, when the Muse of Pity o'er me stole, And kindled new ideas in my soul; When Nature's rude effusions pour'd along, Impell'd by Fancy, rais'd th'unpolish'd song; Then, when Imagination—Charming Maid, In all the rainbow's lively hues array'd, ( 2 ) Bade me her visionary heights explore, And taught my unfledg'd pinions how to soar, Till my heart throbb'd with her prolific fire, And social feeling forc'd th'untutor'd lyre; Till with the woes of Afric deep imprest, I (trembling) held the mirror to each breast; Tho' long th'alternate powers of hope and fear Oppos'd the theme to Truth, to Virtue dear. Daughters of Ireland, you approv'd the song, And bade the Muse her artless task prolong; You smil'd—and still, with innate goodness fraught, Pardon'd each fault, and prais'd each happier thought: Again that Muse collects her active powers, Sisters!—the Theme,—the Strain,—the Muse—are yours. Albion! I love thee—dear paternal plain, Where arts and science, ease and freedom reign; Where commerce swells her sails, and plies her oars, And links, in one soft cement, distant shores. I love thee,—yes! while e'er my beating heart Shall thro' my frame its vital warmth impart: And I will love thee, till the hand of death Shall close my eyes, and stop my fault'ring breath. ( 3 ) That sacred zeal which in my bosom glows, Claims a strong interest in thy weal or woes. Oft, when the passing hours of childhood ran, How was I pleas'd thy glorious acts to scan! Oft too, with transport, would I learn thy fame, And boast the lustre of the English name. But when I see thy hands in gore embru'd, Thy gloomy annals stain'd with guiltless blood; Thy stately ships the sea-green wave divide, Fraught with foul crimes, in glaring scarlet dy'd. These—when with Ireland's justice I compare, Her clemency distinguish'd—nobly rare; I blush to see the lustre of each deed, Tarnish'd—and virtuous Ireland's glorious meed. For Ireland, when her sister kingdoms rose, And heap'd on Afric Misery's piercing woes; When link'd in vice, they plough'd the faithless main, With hearts impure—and souls intent on gain; Then firm in Innocence—supremely good In Virtue's awful dignity—she stood, Stood as a rock, which boisterous waves assail, Unmov'd by every loud and threatning gale, ( 4 ) The all seducing lure of gold—she dar'd, And when she weigh'd the crime, she spurn'd the base reward. No—never were her peaceful vessels mann'd To ravage helpless Afric's guiltless land. Albion, thou lovest freedom! why, oh why! Condemn thy brethren thus to pine and die? Yet boast, that thou this darling right to gain, Wouldst spill the flood that flows in every vein, While Ireland's gen'rous sons, as just as brave, Preserve their freedom—nor create one slave. And still disdain to rove thro' trackless seas, By Hell-born fraud, to purchase wealth and ease. Thy daughters! too, Ierne, mild and fair, Oft with the houseless wretch their mercy share. Oft with soft pity, feel their bosoms glow, Before the silent eloquence of woe. But with what transport will their hearts rebound, When Albion's laws shall scatter freedom round. Freedom! thy Name, which gladdens ev'ry plain, Throbs in my heart, and thrills thro' every vein; For soon (blest hope!) on Afric's mourning shore, Thy dawning sun shall rise to set no more; ( 5 ) And soon will every virtuous British peer, Rise with one voice, and send thee smiling there. Ev'n now the Muse anticipates the day, When, struck with awe, posterity shall say, ""Where are the scenes our fathers stain'd with blood, ""And sold the living image of their God. ""Where now the marts—where erst their impious ken ""Defil'd the name of Christian, and—of Men"". Tis yours, ye Powers, who hold a nation's trust, To shine as stars on earth—and dare be just. Tis yours the God-like transport—to bestow, T'assuage distress, to heal the wounds of woe; To ease gall'd Misery of its furrow'd load, And point the path to Virtue and to God: Tis yours, to make the fiend-like tyrant dread The chains he forg'd—and all the snares he spread. To crown, with laurel, merit's humbler charm, And shew fair Justice in her patriot form. On you does Albion gaze with anxious eye, And views the all-unravelling moment nigh, When every vote decisive fate shall give, Sanction the trade—or bid your brethren live. ( 6 ) May then—I must—I will the thought impart, The warm effusion of a feeling heart. An heart, which grandeur never taught to sigh, Which far from observation's critic eye, Far from the dazzling ken of trophied fame, Nor sought—nor found—nor wished to find—a name. An heart—around whose fibres—Nature threw Sympathy's seeds, and watch'd them as they grew. Thus have I learnt to melt at Misery's tale, And thus—the woes of Afric to bewail. And this impels me boldly to impart, The warm effusion of a feeling heart. May then those Powers, who guard a Nation's trust, To Virtue firm—benevolently just, Inspir'd with awe, the fateful judgment weigh, And hear alike the rich and poor man's plea! May no mean bias warp each generous breast, By all their brethren's bleeding wrongs imprest. But may the just, the grand decision be, What their immortal souls will never fear to see. Ah! think e'er yet the final day is past, How would you act—the present hour your last! ( 7 ) Think, when arraign'd before the bar of Heav'n, What vote you'll most sincerely wish to have given! You will reflect too—that with jealous eyes, All Europe views your shame or glory rise. You must reflect that—your decisive nod, Or plants the olive, or Oppression's rod, That France has kindled now the generous flame, And your grand precedent will raise her aim, Enlighten every philanthropic soul, Or bid dire Slavery ravage—sans controul. You will reflect—this hellish traffic o'er Commerce might reign—on Afric's peaceful shore; That link'd in friendship's bonds, you more would gain, Than ever Avarice with her serpent train. This weigh'd—may He, whose fingers point the course, That binds the fiery comets raging force, Illumine all your minds—and to your heart The gracious dictates of his love impart. Commerce! thou complicated gift, which Heaven, In wrath, or mercy, to mankind hath given; Thou Janus, who two faces always wears; One, fraught with smiles, and one with wrinkled cares. Parent of luxury! and nurse of trade, Who gave to polish'd vice its darkest shade. ( 8 ) Thou varied power! whose potent frown can make Th'affrighted mariner's cold heart strings ake. To thee what tides of wealth does Albion owe! The laurel'd wreaths, which crown her conquering brow; To thee—that now supreme in regal sway, Her sister isles salute her—Queen of Sea. To thee—that in her lap each India pours Its silken softness, and its treasured stores. To thee—that link'd in Traffic's wealthiest chain, She sucks the fattest produce of each plain. To thee—that urg'd by Power's despotic scourge, For free-born men does Albion fetters forge. By thee—what perfidies, what frauds arise? By thee—the groves of Afric echo sighs. Still with unequal hand thy favours flow, And some thou load'st with wealth—and some with woe. Lo! where thy stately ships majestic ride, And o'er the whitening billows smoothly glide; Pity such forms, so beauteous and so fair, Whose flowing streamers kiss the yielding air; Who eager borne before the fav'ring wind Skim with light haste—nor leave a trace behind, ( 9 ) While the tir'd sailors on the decks repose, And lose in sleep-Lethean all their woes; And o'er the waves the gilded sun-beams play, Or thro' the shrouds reflect a feebler ray: Pity such hellish deeds should those employ To rob, to slay, to ravage, and destroy; To snatch their brethren from a pleasant home, And drag them rudely to a living tomb; Where foul Oppression does their peace destroy, That e'en Hope sickens at the thought of joy. Where are thy thunders?—Heav'n—thy lightning's breath? Oh! whelm the tyrants in a vengeful death; Bid thy waves roar—thy storms tremendous rise, And angry flashes dart from low'ring skies. But cease, thou Muse, for in my soul there flows, A sound more sweet than zephyr to the rose: A sound which breathes an od'rous fragrance round, And makes th'exulting heart with joy rebound; Blest is the voice—'tis Liberty—'tis life - 'Tis Ireland's,—Albion's hope—her Senate's strife; ( 10 ) For soon, transporting thought! that strife will cease, And—it must be—to Afric whisper peace! Fir'd at the theme, each bold idea wrings, And unrestrain'd, the muse of Fancy sings: Expands her daring pinions wide, ascends, And dares defy grim Slavery's selfish friends: In vain cool Reason claims her sov'reign sway; She spurns the feeble claim, and bounds away: She views—or thinks she views—when grief, nor woe, The overseer's stern frown—and sterner blow, The sable matron's tear, the heartfelt sigh, The reeking back—dire horror—suppliant cry; When all the ills which rend the Negro's soul Shall disappear—and freedom crown the whole. Oh! with what transport, with what rapturous fear Will they the great, the Heav'n-sent blessing hear How will the varied passions of their soul With bliss too high for speech their acts controul? The swimming tear! big throb! the speaking eye! And all th'unutterable extacy! Even now methinks the melting scene I see, And every passion struggling to get free; His feet they kiss who did the news impart, Embrace his knees, and clasp him to their heart: ( 11 ) Lost in a flood of rapture—all they view Seems but a dream—they scarce can think it true. Oh! Britons—to your philanthropic breast Has Fancy ne'er this God-like scene addrest, Giv'n to the high-wrought piece each varying hue, Then told you—you alone could make it true? Oh! if your bosoms knew the boundless joy Which would your every faculty employ, You would not forfeit such an heart-felt glow, For all the wealth that slavery can bestow; Think not the scene in shades too high I paint: Ah no! to cloath my thought the powers of speech is faint; For did not Truth himself the precept leave, Tis far more blest to give than to receive. Now view we calmer joys—those transports past, (For not the greatest bliss on earth can last:) View now—while Fancy kindles at the sight, Each rapture mellow'd into soft delight; Each wild effusion which their hearts will prove Lost in a flow of gratitude and love: View them to peace, to liberty restor'd, And all the sweets their Afric can afford; ( 12 ) When British learning shall its light impart, Dispel the chaos of the Negro's heart; Diffuse fair knowledge, scientific lore, And to the rights of Men their souls restore; When Gospel truths shall dart an heav'nly ray, And slaves enfranchis'd own a Saviour's sway; When we shall point the narrow path and shew That path by precept and example too; When Christian traders are by justice sway'd, And rapine foul gives place to peaceful trade; When Albion shall supreme delight bestow, And with supreme delight feel her own bosom glow; Thus mutual good conferring and conferr'd, Will prove that ""Virtue is its own reward."" So in some finish'd piece of music—wrought By master-hands, and to perfection brought, The varying parts in graceful order roll, And each contributes to th'harmonious whole; Lo! (for in Fancy's vain illusive glass The Muse can trace each image—as they pass; Oh! would that Muse the lively pow'r possest, To hold the mirror to the thinking breast; ( 13 ) That every heart its justice should confess, As the rough chisel can the stone impress. Oh! that with fire and energy divine, The truths I feel might glow in every line.) Lo! where to Afric now our fleets are brought, With the full stores of commerce richly fraught; Where the stern keels the murmuring waves divide, Which hoarse rebounding lash the well-built side: Now fill'd with hope her craggy cliffs they gain, And now safe moor'd they form a woody plain. Lo! where th'inhabitants surround the strand, Eager to view the welcome vessels land: No more with shrieks of terror and dismay, They see them anchor in the wonted bay; No more with heart-felt horror and affright, Their blood runs colder at the hateful sight; But with rejoicing soul their nimble feet Skim with light bound their generous friends to greet; For now the sons of Albion come no more To load with woes the desolated shore; No more Oppression's sanction'd scourges rise To burst soft Love and Nature's hallow'd ties, ( 14 ) To rend the agonizing heart—to shew That men call'd Christians may be monsters too; That they who own a Saviour's gentle sway, And at his altars prostrate homage pay; Who hear (at home) his name with reverent awe Abroad—can trample on his every law; Can load with woe a brother's sinking soul, And bid the seas of Anguish o'er him roll: No more sits gloomy Horror brooding round, But arts, industry, peace, and wealth abound; And (every former injury forgot) The sable tribes desert the low-roof'd cot; With lively haste the whiten'd beach they climb, White by the snowy hand of hoary Time, And in the genuine language of the heart Their confidence and gratitude impart. Ah! say not you whose av'rice urged the deed, Who with unblushing front for slav'ry plead; Say not their savage breast and vagrant soul, No gentle arts can soften and controul, That vain the beams Benev'lence would impart, To thaw the hardness of their rugged heart; ( 15 ) That sooner might the Sun's prolific ray, Or freeze the wax, or melt the stubborn clay; That sooner may th'hyena fawning lie, Or smooth'd the rocks whose summits brave the sky; Or endless bloom surround the mount's bleak side, Than tam'd the souls for which a Saviour died. Sophist! in vain thy tongue its reas'ning pours, Tho' grac'd with oratory's sweetest flowers; Tho' Orpheus-like thy eloquence could move The listening stones, or charm the whispering grove; Yet vain thy aim injustice to defend, And with th'unerring laws of God contend; For Truth will shine with undiminish'd blaze, In spite of man's base arts to cloud its rays; Think'st thou that He, who did all Beings form With reason's spark, forgot their hearts to warm; Or that its vital ray his laws design'd, For our fair skins—for them gross error blind? No; He whose wisdom guides this massy ball, Gives a large portion of his love to—all: And all, by Nature, rude and wild were born, Who range the woods, or courts, or camps adorn: 'Tis education gives the polish'd gloss, Refines the metal from the worthless dross: ( 16 ) Prunes, with a careful hand, the opening shoot, And tends, with anxious care, the promis'd fruit. The mind of man—like unextracted ore, Much dregs contains—but solid virtue more: 'Tis education clears those dregs away, And gilds the virtues, with a tenfold ray. Improves wild Nature's nursling—gives the soul The seal which stamps a value on the whole. And as the marble in the quarry lies, Its hidden worth conceal'd from human eyes, Useless its huge unwieldy bulk remains, Nor ought of just proportion'd grace retains; But when the forming hand of strength and art, Shall to its form, united force impart; When all the workmen's varying arts apply'd, And to new symmetry the parts divide: The sculptor's dignity, the pencil's ease, In harmonizing beauty, join to please; The fair and polish'd members gradual rise, 'Till the whole piece perfected, meets our eyes: Just so the Negro, can his sable frame, Th'internal value of his soul proclaim? Ingulph'd in misery—with pain depress'd, These harrow up the feelings of his breast; ( 17 ) Torn from his friends, bereav'd of every joy, Which might his mental faculties employ, Degraded, and dishonour'd—where, ah! where Shall sense and reason's blooming flowers appear? Where would the eloquence of Grattan shine? Where Sheridan's address?—where Pitt divine? If o'er their heads did Slavery's mandates roll, And freeze the gen'rous current of their soul. For only those who know it—may impart, How grief can mar the feelings of the heart, Check every noble thought—and warm desire, And bid poor Genius' blasted hope expire. How the keen stings of pamper'd pride annoy, With venom'd point, mean merit's modest joy; Till of his maker's fairest gifts bereft, A rude and senseless lump is only left. So have I seen the ductile wax imprest, Till all th'original appeared confest; But when expos'd to Phoebus' scorching ray, The powerless image faintly melts away: Or as a plant, which 'neath the gard'ner's hand, In rising beauty, does its leaves expand, When lo! the pinching blasts of winter rise, And chill the withering stalk—it fades and dies. ( 18 ) Cease then, ye pleaders, in so bad a cause, Who only speak, as sordid interest draws. Cease, with a thread-bare cloak, your crimes to hide, For God will of his works be justified. But woe! to thee, proud wretch, by Satan led, Who on thy maker's laws does rudely tread, Who violates the rights which Nature gave, And dooms thy fellows to an early grave. Know there's a power who will avenge the wrong, Tho' yet his love-redeeming suffers long. Know there's a time, when truth distinct and clear, Shall onward roll, and shake thy heart with fear, When all the stings of Conscience brought to light, Shall rise with tenfold horror—to thy sight. When all the secret pangs of deep remorse, Shall stand before thee, with redoubled force; Shall stand and tell thee, in that awful hour, How oft they warn'd—how oft thou spurn'dst their power. Oh! keep (while yet thou may'st) these thoughts in view, Think—and reflection shall declare them true. Repent, while yet repentance may be given, Nor longer dare the vengeful ire of heav'n. And He, whose mercy would our crimes forgive, May make his grace burst forth, and bid thee live! ( 19 ) In those blest days, when Liberty shall reign, For it must be—on injur'd Afric's plain, When curst Oppression's chains shall wound no more, Nor human flesh be sold for filthy ore; In heart-felt language, how will they reveal, The warm, the grateful sentiments they feel! Oh! you! methinks they cry, whose bosoms know, The dear delight to sooth the pangs of woe! Who oft to want your lib'ral hands extend, And fearless rose, th'afflicted Negro's friend, Who with unwearied calls, and ceaseless cries, Have forc'd your Senate in the cause to rise: And thou, that Senate's boast,—thy nation's pride, Freedom's firm friends, and Pity's gen'rous guide, Great Pitt! whom ties of av'rice ne'er could bind, Nor warp the noble bias of thy mind! And you, ye daughters of the sister isles! Who blest in Charity's benignant smiles, Who cheer th'afflicted—wipe the tearful eye, And bid the heart of sorrow cease to sigh; With hearts unknowing—innocent and gay, ) You took the plant, for which we dearly pay; ) But when you knew the price—you push'd it far away. ) ( 20 ) Ye friends of liberty and peace—to you What thanks, what rapturous gratitude are due! No words can paint the feelings of our soul; No language can our speechless thoughts controul. But, He who knows the goodness of your heart, Which—like himself—would joy to all impart, He saw your gen'rous motive, He will shed His choicest blessings o'er each virtuous head. Oh! may his grace preserve, his wisdom guard, His shield protect you, and his love reward! Such! sisters, such! will be the Negro's thought; His breast with every warm affection fraught. Nor small the glory which to you belongs, Whose gentle bosoms mourn'd for all their wrongs, Wept for their woes, and burn'd with honest shame, To know them sanction'd by an English name. Who saw—while slav'ry sicken'd at the sight, The sun of Freedom rise with dawning light, O'er dark Oppression dart his glorious ray; You saw—and hail'd with joy his rising sway! Fain would the Muse on high-rais'd pinions soar, And to your virtues point one effort more, ( 21 ) T'improve your plan, your God-like labours crown, Which heaven-born Justice will applaud and own; Rise, Sisters! be your generous task complete, And with just scorn rude Folly's giggle meet. Lo! where around the mirth-inspiring board With either India's choicest produce stor'd; Where the pleas'd guests salute the sparkling glass, And wit and wine in swift succession pass; There haply oft the saturate bowl* may flow With sweets impregnate drawn from bitterest woe; Rich juice extracted from the reeking whip, And snatch'd untasted from a brother's lip. Ah Sisters! you on whose resistless tongue The sweetest flowers of eloquence are hung, Who ever facile at Compassion's call Alike the fav'rites and the friends of all: This can you see, nor urge your peaceful sway To push the dear-bought beverage far away! Say not—no power of your's so far extends, These are your brothers, husbands, sons, or friends, Whose precepts or whose laws you erst obey'd, And reverence due concomitantly paid; * Punch. ( 22 ) And whom—(as God and Nature's voice proclaim,) To please your wish, to sooth and calm your aim; Will these reject your small, your just request, When urg'd with meekness—yet with warmth exprest? Have you no influence? you whose bosoms feel Pity's soft glow—and Freedom's honest zeal! Or dread you Epicurean jests to meet, With laughter's loud, unmeaning roar replete: - In every age are sons of Belial found But their shafts pointless on themselves rebound. O'er Virtue's efforts throw a lucent ray, And their own impotence of mind display. Be theirs—the secret pangs of guilt to know The stings of Conscience—and repentant woe. Remorse which Pleasure's specious cups conceal, And griefs which but a Saviour's hand can heal. But our's—with faith the narrow path to climb, To mourn the sinner—yet abhor the crime. With Heaven's lov'd attribute—our gentle guide, And if we err—we err on Mercy's side. Our wants—our weakness—every secret sigh, Our kind Creator views with pitying eye; ( 23 ) And if our efforts rise in Virtue's cause, He sees those efforts, nor disdains applause. - To Him—(who every act and thought will prove In the large scale of universal love: Who, by this rule, will favour or condemn, (""What ye from men desire—do ye to them."") The good man's off'ring of a pious thought, The poor man's pray'r, with resignation fraught, The philanthropic breast—whose social glow, Participates its fellow's weal or woe. To him—of more transcendant worth appear, Than all the trophies of triumphant war. So—when, with seeming chance, our wishes glide, With unseen hand, does he o'er all preside; Touches the secret spring which moves the soul, Observes its sequence—and ordains the whole. Blest be the man—and still rever'd his name, Whose breast first felt the spark of kindling flame; Who did each deep recess of guilt unfold, And dar'd the tyrant's vengeance—nobly bold. Explor'd our cruelties—our traffic curst, By sin created—and by habit nurst. ( 24 ) Bid, with firm voice, his blind compatriots rise, And throw the veil of darkness from their eyes; Who shew'd, with heav'n taught finger, how to scan The path of rectitude 'tween man and man; Till others caught the sympathetic flame, And did the woes of Afric loud proclaim; Rais'd for themselves a monumental crown; A sacred trophy of a just renown: And, in the sight of heav'n, more glory won, Than Caesar fam'd, or Philip's martial son. For in those realms, to guilt, to fear, unknown, Virtue may hold pre-eminence alone. For she—when yon brigh[t] moon's refulgent host, 'Mid nature's gen'ral ruin, shall be lost, Will, from that wreck, unfading lustre bring, And rise the hand-maid of our holy king; Securely soar, with animated powers, And bloom immortal—in celestial bowers. So, when (e'er summer opes her perfum'd vest,) The fost'ring earth receives her little guest, With care paternal hides its tender form, Safe from the piercing rigours of the storm; But when their elemental rage is o'er, And awful tempests shake the earth no more; ( 25 ) When Sol darts downward, with prolific ray, And vernal flowers salute his rising sway, The nurtur'd seed disdains its limits scant, Uprears its head—shoots forth a lovely plant; Till, in each grace matur'd, it blossoms fair, And sheds delicious fragrance thro' the air.

MDCCXCII. PREFACE ENCOURAGED by the kind and un- merited Partiality with which the first Part of this little Attempt has been received, I again present to public Observation the spontaneous Effusions of an unpolished Fancy. I fear I may justly incur the Censure of having acted with unbecoming Warmth, though on such an impor- tant, interesting, and inexhaustible Theme. â€“ Compassion for those unhappy Beings, whose Cause I urge,—my own inexperience,—and the Feel- ings of every humane Heart, to which I appeal, must be my Advocates. A POEM ON THE AFRICAN SLAVE TRADE. ERST, when the Muse of Pity o'er me stole, And kindled new ideas in my soul; When Nature's rude effusions pour'd along, Impell'd by Fancy, rais'd th'unpolish'd song; Then, when Imagination—Charming Maid, In all the rainbow's lively hues array'd, ( 2 ) Bade me her visionary heights explore, And taught my unfledg'd pinions how to soar, Till my heart throbb'd with her prolific fire, And social feeling forc'd th'untutor'd lyre; Till with the woes of Afric deep imprest, I (trembling) held the mirror to each breast; Tho' long th'alternate powers of hope and fear Oppos'd the theme to Truth, to Virtue dear. Daughters of Ireland, you approv'd the song, And bade the Muse her artless task prolong; You smil'd—and still, with innate goodness fraught, Pardon'd each fault, and prais'd each happier thought: Again that Muse collects her active powers, Sisters!—the Theme,—the Strain,—the Muse—are yours. Albion! I love thee—dear paternal plain, Where arts and science, ease and freedom reign; Where commerce swells her sails, and plies her oars, And links, in one soft cement, distant shores. I love thee,—yes! while e'er my beating heart Shall thro' my frame its vital warmth impart: And I will love thee, till the hand of death Shall close my eyes, and stop my fault'ring breath. ( 3 ) That sacred zeal which in my bosom glows, Claims a strong interest in thy weal or woes. Oft, when the passing hours of childhood ran, How was I pleas'd thy glorious acts to scan! Oft too, with transport, would I learn thy fame, And boast the lustre of the English name. But when I see thy hands in gore embru'd, Thy gloomy annals stain'd with guiltless blood; Thy stately ships the sea-green wave divide, Fraught with foul crimes, in glaring scarlet dy'd. These—when with Ireland's justice I compare, Her clemency distinguish'd—nobly rare; I blush to see the lustre of each deed, Tarnish'd—and virtuous Ireland's glorious meed. For Ireland, when her sister kingdoms rose, And heap'd on Afric Misery's piercing woes; When link'd in vice, they plough'd the faithless main, With hearts impure—and souls intent on gain; Then firm in Innocence—supremely good In Virtue's awful dignity—she stood, Stood as a rock, which boisterous waves assail, Unmov'd by every loud and threatning gale, ( 4 ) The all seducing lure of gold—she dar'd, And when she weigh'd the crime, she spurn'd the base reward. No—never were her peaceful vessels mann'd To ravage helpless Afric's guiltless land. Albion, thou lovest freedom! why, oh why! Condemn thy brethren thus to pine and die? Yet boast, that thou this darling right to gain, Wouldst spill the flood that flows in every vein, While Ireland's gen'rous sons, as just as brave, Preserve their freedom—nor create one slave. And still disdain to rove thro' trackless seas, By Hell-born fraud, to purchase wealth and ease. Thy daughters! too, Ierne, mild and fair, Oft with the houseless wretch their mercy share. Oft with soft pity, feel their bosoms glow, Before the silent eloquence of woe. But with what transport will their hearts rebound, When Albion's laws shall scatter freedom round. Freedom! thy Name, which gladdens ev'ry plain, Throbs in my heart, and thrills thro' every vein; For soon (blest hope!) on Afric's mourning shore, Thy dawning sun shall rise to set no more; ( 5 ) And soon will every virtuous British peer, Rise with one voice, and send thee smiling there. Ev'n now the Muse anticipates the day, When, struck with awe, posterity shall say, ""Where are the scenes our fathers stain'd with blood, ""And sold the living image of their God. ""Where now the marts—where erst their impious ken ""Defil'd the name of Christian, and—of Men"". Tis yours, ye Powers, who hold a nation's trust, To shine as stars on earth—and dare be just. Tis yours the God-like transport—to bestow, T'assuage distress, to heal the wounds of woe; To ease gall'd Misery of its furrow'd load, And point the path to Virtue and to God: Tis yours, to make the fiend-like tyrant dread The chains he forg'd—and all the snares he spread. To crown, with laurel, merit's humbler charm, And shew fair Justice in her patriot form. On you does Albion gaze with anxious eye, And views the all-unravelling moment nigh, When every vote decisive fate shall give, Sanction the trade—or bid your brethren live. ( 6 ) May then—I must—I will the thought impart, The warm effusion of a feeling heart. An heart, which grandeur never taught to sigh, Which far from observation's critic eye, Far from the dazzling ken of trophied fame, Nor sought—nor found—nor wished to find—a name. An heart—around whose fibres—Nature threw Sympathy's seeds, and watch'd them as they grew. Thus have I learnt to melt at Misery's tale, And thus—the woes of Afric to bewail. And this impels me boldly to impart, The warm effusion of a feeling heart. May then those Powers, who guard a Nation's trust, To Virtue firm—benevolently just, Inspir'd with awe, the fateful judgment weigh, And hear alike the rich and poor man's plea! May no mean bias warp each generous breast, By all their brethren's bleeding wrongs imprest. But may the just, the grand decision be, What their immortal souls will never fear to see. Ah! think e'er yet the final day is past, How would you act—the present hour your last! ( 7 ) Think, when arraign'd before the bar of Heav'n, What vote you'll most sincerely wish to have given! You will reflect too—that with jealous eyes, All Europe views your shame or glory rise. You must reflect that—your decisive nod, Or plants the olive, or Oppression's rod, That France has kindled now the generous flame, And your grand precedent will raise her aim, Enlighten every philanthropic soul, Or bid dire Slavery ravage—sans controul. You will reflect—this hellish traffic o'er Commerce might reign—on Afric's peaceful shore; That link'd in friendship's bonds, you more would gain, Than ever Avarice with her serpent train. This weigh'd—may He, whose fingers point the course, That binds the fiery comets raging force, Illumine all your minds—and to your heart The gracious dictates of his love impart. Commerce! thou complicated gift, which Heaven, In wrath, or mercy, to mankind hath given; Thou Janus, who two faces always wears; One, fraught with smiles, and one with wrinkled cares. Parent of luxury! and nurse of trade, Who gave to polish'd vice its darkest shade. ( 8 ) Thou varied power! whose potent frown can make Th'affrighted mariner's cold heart strings ake. To thee what tides of wealth does Albion owe! The laurel'd wreaths, which crown her conquering brow; To thee—that now supreme in regal sway, Her sister isles salute her—Queen of Sea. To thee—that in her lap each India pours Its silken softness, and its treasured stores. To thee—that link'd in Traffic's wealthiest chain, She sucks the fattest produce of each plain. To thee—that urg'd by Power's despotic scourge, For free-born men does Albion fetters forge. By thee—what perfidies, what frauds arise? By thee—the groves of Afric echo sighs. Still with unequal hand thy favours flow, And some thou load'st with wealth—and some with woe. Lo! where thy stately ships majestic ride, And o'er the whitening billows smoothly glide; Pity such forms, so beauteous and so fair, Whose flowing streamers kiss the yielding air; Who eager borne before the fav'ring wind Skim with light haste—nor leave a trace behind, ( 9 ) While the tir'd sailors on the decks repose, And lose in sleep-Lethean all their woes; And o'er the waves the gilded sun-beams play, Or thro' the shrouds reflect a feebler ray: Pity such hellish deeds should those employ To rob, to slay, to ravage, and destroy; To snatch their brethren from a pleasant home, And drag them rudely to a living tomb; Where foul Oppression does their peace destroy, That e'en Hope sickens at the thought of joy. Where are thy thunders?—Heav'n—thy lightning's breath? Oh! whelm the tyrants in a vengeful death; Bid thy waves roar—thy storms tremendous rise, And angry flashes dart from low'ring skies. But cease, thou Muse, for in my soul there flows, A sound more sweet than zephyr to the rose: A sound which breathes an od'rous fragrance round, And makes th'exulting heart with joy rebound; Blest is the voice—'tis Liberty—'tis life - 'Tis Ireland's,—Albion's hope—her Senate's strife; ( 10 ) For soon, transporting thought! that strife will cease, And—it must be—to Afric whisper peace! Fir'd at the theme, each bold idea wrings, And unrestrain'd, the muse of Fancy sings: Expands her daring pinions wide, ascends, And dares defy grim Slavery's selfish friends: In vain cool Reason claims her sov'reign sway; She spurns the feeble claim, and bounds away: She views—or thinks she views—when grief, nor woe, The overseer's stern frown—and sterner blow, The sable matron's tear, the heartfelt sigh, The reeking back—dire horror—suppliant cry; When all the ills which rend the Negro's soul Shall disappear—and freedom crown the whole. Oh! with what transport, with what rapturous fear Will they the great, the Heav'n-sent blessing hear How will the varied passions of their soul With bliss too high for speech their acts controul? The swimming tear! big throb! the speaking eye! And all th'unutterable extacy! Even now methinks the melting scene I see, And every passion struggling to get free; His feet they kiss who did the news impart, Embrace his knees, and clasp him to their heart: ( 11 ) Lost in a flood of rapture—all they view Seems but a dream—they scarce can think it true. Oh! Britons—to your philanthropic breast Has Fancy ne'er this God-like scene addrest, Giv'n to the high-wrought piece each varying hue, Then told you—you alone could make it true? Oh! if your bosoms knew the boundless joy Which would your every faculty employ, You would not forfeit such an heart-felt glow, For all the wealth that slavery can bestow; Think not the scene in shades too high I paint: Ah no! to cloath my thought the powers of speech is faint; For did not Truth himself the precept leave, Tis far more blest to give than to receive. Now view we calmer joys—those transports past, (For not the greatest bliss on earth can last:) View now—while Fancy kindles at the sight, Each rapture mellow'd into soft delight; Each wild effusion which their hearts will prove Lost in a flow of gratitude and love: View them to peace, to liberty restor'd, And all the sweets their Afric can afford; ( 12 ) When British learning shall its light impart, Dispel the chaos of the Negro's heart; Diffuse fair knowledge, scientific lore, And to the rights of Men their souls restore; When Gospel truths shall dart an heav'nly ray, And slaves enfranchis'd own a Saviour's sway; When we shall point the narrow path and shew That path by precept and example too; When Christian traders are by justice sway'd, And rapine foul gives place to peaceful trade; When Albion shall supreme delight bestow, And with supreme delight feel her own bosom glow; Thus mutual good conferring and conferr'd, Will prove that ""Virtue is its own reward."" So in some finish'd piece of music—wrought By master-hands, and to perfection brought, The varying parts in graceful order roll, And each contributes to th'harmonious whole; Lo! (for in Fancy's vain illusive glass The Muse can trace each image—as they pass; Oh! would that Muse the lively pow'r possest, To hold the mirror to the thinking breast; ( 13 ) That every heart its justice should confess, As the rough chisel can the stone impress. Oh! that with fire and energy divine, The truths I feel might glow in every line.) Lo! where to Afric now our fleets are brought, With the full stores of commerce richly fraught; Where the stern keels the murmuring waves divide, Which hoarse rebounding lash the well-built side: Now fill'd with hope her craggy cliffs they gain, And now safe moor'd they form a woody plain. Lo! where th'inhabitants surround the strand, Eager to view the welcome vessels land: No more with shrieks of terror and dismay, They see them anchor in the wonted bay; No more with heart-felt horror and affright, Their blood runs colder at the hateful sight; But with rejoicing soul their nimble feet Skim with light bound their generous friends to greet; For now the sons of Albion come no more To load with woes the desolated shore; No more Oppression's sanction'd scourges rise To burst soft Love and Nature's hallow'd ties, ( 14 ) To rend the agonizing heart—to shew That men call'd Christians may be monsters too; That they who own a Saviour's gentle sway, And at his altars prostrate homage pay; Who hear (at home) his name with reverent awe Abroad—can trample on his every law; Can load with woe a brother's sinking soul, And bid the seas of Anguish o'er him roll: No more sits gloomy Horror brooding round, But arts, industry, peace, and wealth abound; And (every former injury forgot) The sable tribes desert the low-roof'd cot; With lively haste the whiten'd beach they climb, White by the snowy hand of hoary Time, And in the genuine language of the heart Their confidence and gratitude impart. Ah! say not you whose av'rice urged the deed, Who with unblushing front for slav'ry plead; Say not their savage breast and vagrant soul, No gentle arts can soften and controul, That vain the beams Benev'lence would impart, To thaw the hardness of their rugged heart; ( 15 ) That sooner might the Sun's prolific ray, Or freeze the wax, or melt the stubborn clay; That sooner may th'hyena fawning lie, Or smooth'd the rocks whose summits brave the sky; Or endless bloom surround the mount's bleak side, Than tam'd the souls for which a Saviour died. Sophist! in vain thy tongue its reas'ning pours, Tho' grac'd with oratory's sweetest flowers; Tho' Orpheus-like thy eloquence could move The listening stones, or charm the whispering grove; Yet vain thy aim injustice to defend, And with th'unerring laws of God contend; For Truth will shine with undiminish'd blaze, In spite of man's base arts to cloud its rays; Think'st thou that He, who did all Beings form With reason's spark, forgot their hearts to warm; Or that its vital ray his laws design'd, For our fair skins—for them gross error blind? No; He whose wisdom guides this massy ball, Gives a large portion of his love to—all: And all, by Nature, rude and wild were born, Who range the woods, or courts, or camps adorn: 'Tis education gives the polish'd gloss, Refines the metal from the worthless dross: ( 16 ) Prunes, with a careful hand, the opening shoot, And tends, with anxious care, the promis'd fruit. The mind of man—like unextracted ore, Much dregs contains—but solid virtue more: 'Tis education clears those dregs away, And gilds the virtues, with a tenfold ray. Improves wild Nature's nursling—gives the soul The seal which stamps a value on the whole. And as the marble in the quarry lies, Its hidden worth conceal'd from human eyes, Useless its huge unwieldy bulk remains, Nor ought of just proportion'd grace retains; But when the forming hand of strength and art, Shall to its form, united force impart; When all the workmen's varying arts apply'd, And to new symmetry the parts divide: The sculptor's dignity, the pencil's ease, In harmonizing beauty, join to please; The fair and polish'd members gradual rise, 'Till the whole piece perfected, meets our eyes: Just so the Negro, can his sable frame, Th'internal value of his soul proclaim? Ingulph'd in misery—with pain depress'd, These harrow up the feelings of his breast; ( 17 ) Torn from his friends, bereav'd of every joy, Which might his mental faculties employ, Degraded, and dishonour'd—where, ah! where Shall sense and reason's blooming flowers appear? Where would the eloquence of Grattan shine? Where Sheridan's address?—where Pitt divine? If o'er their heads did Slavery's mandates roll, And freeze the gen'rous current of their soul. For only those who know it—may impart, How grief can mar the feelings of the heart, Check every noble thought—and warm desire, And bid poor Genius' blasted hope expire. How the keen stings of pamper'd pride annoy, With venom'd point, mean merit's modest joy; Till of his maker's fairest gifts bereft, A rude and senseless lump is only left. So have I seen the ductile wax imprest, Till all th'original appeared confest; But when expos'd to Phoebus' scorching ray, The powerless image faintly melts away: Or as a plant, which 'neath the gard'ner's hand, In rising beauty, does its leaves expand, When lo! the pinching blasts of winter rise, And chill the withering stalk—it fades and dies. ( 18 ) Cease then, ye pleaders, in so bad a cause, Who only speak, as sordid interest draws. Cease, with a thread-bare cloak, your crimes to hide, For God will of his works be justified. But woe! to thee, proud wretch, by Satan led, Who on thy maker's laws does rudely tread, Who violates the rights which Nature gave, And dooms thy fellows to an early grave. Know there's a power who will avenge the wrong, Tho' yet his love-redeeming suffers long. Know there's a time, when truth distinct and clear, Shall onward roll, and shake thy heart with fear, When all the stings of Conscience brought to light, Shall rise with tenfold horror—to thy sight. When all the secret pangs of deep remorse, Shall stand before thee, with redoubled force; Shall stand and tell thee, in that awful hour, How oft they warn'd—how oft thou spurn'dst their power. Oh! keep (while yet thou may'st) these thoughts in view, Think—and reflection shall declare them true. Repent, while yet repentance may be given, Nor longer dare the vengeful ire of heav'n. And He, whose mercy would our crimes forgive, May make his grace burst forth, and bid thee live! ( 19 ) In those blest days, when Liberty shall reign, For it must be—on injur'd Afric's plain, When curst Oppression's chains shall wound no more, Nor human flesh be sold for filthy ore; In heart-felt language, how will they reveal, The warm, the grateful sentiments they feel! Oh! you! methinks they cry, whose bosoms know, The dear delight to sooth the pangs of woe! Who oft to want your lib'ral hands extend, And fearless rose, th'afflicted Negro's friend, Who with unwearied calls, and ceaseless cries, Have forc'd your Senate in the cause to rise: And thou, that Senate's boast,—thy nation's pride, Freedom's firm friends, and Pity's gen'rous guide, Great Pitt! whom ties of av'rice ne'er could bind, Nor warp the noble bias of thy mind! And you, ye daughters of the sister isles! Who blest in Charity's benignant smiles, Who cheer th'afflicted—wipe the tearful eye, And bid the heart of sorrow cease to sigh; With hearts unknowing—innocent and gay, ) You took the plant, for which we dearly pay; ) But when you knew the price—you push'd it far away. ) ( 20 ) Ye friends of liberty and peace—to you What thanks, what rapturous gratitude are due! No words can paint the feelings of our soul; No language can our speechless thoughts controul. But, He who knows the goodness of your heart, Which—like himself—would joy to all impart, He saw your gen'rous motive, He will shed His choicest blessings o'er each virtuous head. Oh! may his grace preserve, his wisdom guard, His shield protect you, and his love reward! Such! sisters, such! will be the Negro's thought; His breast with every warm affection fraught. Nor small the glory which to you belongs, Whose gentle bosoms mourn'd for all their wrongs, Wept for their woes, and burn'd with honest shame, To know them sanction'd by an English name. Who saw—while slav'ry sicken'd at the sight, The sun of Freedom rise with dawning light, O'er dark Oppression dart his glorious ray; You saw—and hail'd with joy his rising sway! Fain would the Muse on high-rais'd pinions soar, And to your virtues point one effort more, ( 21 ) T'improve your plan, your God-like labours crown, Which heaven-born Justice will applaud and own; Rise, Sisters! be your generous task complete, And with just scorn rude Folly's giggle meet. Lo! where around the mirth-inspiring board With either India's choicest produce stor'd; Where the pleas'd guests salute the sparkling glass, And wit and wine in swift succession pass; There haply oft the saturate bowl* may flow With sweets impregnate drawn from bitterest woe; Rich juice extracted from the reeking whip, And snatch'd untasted from a brother's lip. Ah Sisters! you on whose resistless tongue The sweetest flowers of eloquence are hung, Who ever facile at Compassion's call Alike the fav'rites and the friends of all: This can you see, nor urge your peaceful sway To push the dear-bought beverage far away! Say not—no power of your's so far extends, These are your brothers, husbands, sons, or friends, Whose precepts or whose laws you erst obey'd, And reverence due concomitantly paid; * Punch. ( 22 ) And whom—(as God and Nature's voice proclaim,) To please your wish, to sooth and calm your aim; Will these reject your small, your just request, When urg'd with meekness—yet with warmth exprest? Have you no influence? you whose bosoms feel Pity's soft glow—and Freedom's honest zeal! Or dread you Epicurean jests to meet, With laughter's loud, unmeaning roar replete: - In every age are sons of Belial found But their shafts pointless on themselves rebound. O'er Virtue's efforts throw a lucent ray, And their own impotence of mind display. Be theirs—the secret pangs of guilt to know The stings of Conscience—and repentant woe. Remorse which Pleasure's specious cups conceal, And griefs which but a Saviour's hand can heal. But our's—with faith the narrow path to climb, To mourn the sinner—yet abhor the crime. With Heaven's lov'd attribute—our gentle guide, And if we err—we err on Mercy's side. Our wants—our weakness—every secret sigh, Our kind Creator views with pitying eye; ( 23 ) And if our efforts rise in Virtue's cause, He sees those efforts, nor disdains applause. - To Him—(who every act and thought will prove In the large scale of universal love: Who, by this rule, will favour or condemn, (""What ye from men desire—do ye to them."") The good man's off'ring of a pious thought, The poor man's pray'r, with resignation fraught, The philanthropic breast—whose social glow, Participates its fellow's weal or woe. To him—of more transcendant worth appear, Than all the trophies of triumphant war. So—when, with seeming chance, our wishes glide, With unseen hand, does he o'er all preside; Touches the secret spring which moves the soul, Observes its sequence—and ordains the whole. Blest be the man—and still rever'd his name, Whose breast first felt the spark of kindling flame; Who did each deep recess of guilt unfold, And dar'd the tyrant's vengeance—nobly bold. Explor'd our cruelties—our traffic curst, By sin created—and by habit nurst. ( 24 ) Bid, with firm voice, his blind compatriots rise, And throw the veil of darkness from their eyes; Who shew'd, with heav'n taught finger, how to scan The path of rectitude 'tween man and man; Till others caught the sympathetic flame, And did the woes of Afric loud proclaim; Rais'd for themselves a monumental crown; A sacred trophy of a just renown: And, in the sight of heav'n, more glory won, Than Caesar fam'd, or Philip's martial son. For in those realms, to guilt, to fear, unknown, Virtue may hold pre-eminence alone. For she—when yon brigh[t] moon's refulgent host, 'Mid nature's gen'ral ruin, shall be lost, Will, from that wreck, unfading lustre bring, And rise the hand-maid of our holy king; Securely soar, with animated powers, And bloom immortal—in celestial bowers. So, when (e'er summer opes her perfum'd vest,) The fost'ring earth receives her little guest, With care paternal hides its tender form, Safe from the piercing rigours of the storm; But when their elemental rage is o'er, And awful tempests shake the earth no more; ( 25 ) When Sol darts downward, with prolific ray, And vernal flowers salute his rising sway, The nurtur'd seed disdains its limits scant, Uprears its head—shoots forth a lovely plant; Till, in each grace matur'd, it blossoms fair, And sheds delicious fragrance thro' the air.
