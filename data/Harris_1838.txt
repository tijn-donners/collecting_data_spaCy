John Harris
'The Fall of Slavery' (1838)
Musing by a mossy fountain,
   In the blossom month of May,
Saw I coming down a mountain
   An old man whose locks were grey;
And the flowery valleys echoed,
   As he sang his earnest lay.

"Prayer is heard, the chain is riven,
   Shout it over land and sea;
Slavery from earth is driven,
   And the manacled are free;
Brotherhood in all the nations;
   What a glorious Jubilee!

"God has answered, fall before Him,
   Laud His majesty and might;
On thy knees, O earth, adore Him:
   Now the black is as the white;
Hallelujah! hallelujah!
   Every bondsman free as light.

"Whip and scourge, and fetter broken,
   Far away in darkness hurled;
This a grand and glorious token,
   When millennium fills the world.
Hallelujah! O'er the nations
   Freedom's snowy flag unfurled.

"God has answered! Glory, glory!
   O'er the green earth let it speed;
Sun and stars take up the story,
   Nevermore a slave shall bleed;
Shout deliverance for the freeman,
   Send him succour in his need.

Glory be to God the Giver.
   Slavery now shall brand no more;
From the fountain to the river
   Freedom breathes on every shore.
Hellelujah! Hallelujah!
   Brotherhood the wide world o'er."
